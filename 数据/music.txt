Bunyi yang dihasilkan bergetar dalam susunan nada 2, 3, sampai 4 nada dalam setiap ukuran, baik besar maupun kecil.<br><br>Dictionary of the Sunda Language karya Jonathan Rigg, yang diterbitkan pada tahun 1862 di Batavia, menuliskan bahwa angklung adalah alat musik yang terbuat dari pipa-pipa bambu, yang dipotong ujung-ujungnya, menyerupai pipa-pipa dalam suatu organ, dan diikat bersama dalam suatu bingkai, digetarkan untuk menghasilkan bunyi.

The player manipulates each capsule as it vertically falls 1 unit of space at a time, able to move it left or right and rotate it 90 degrees in either clockwise or counter-clockwise. When four or more capsule halves or viruses of matching color are aligned in vertical or horizontal configurations, they are removed from play. Any remaining capsule halves or whole capsules which are now not supported by a virus or capsule will fall to the bottom of the playing field or until it hits another supported object, and any new 4-in-a-row alignments created from this will also be removed. The main objective is to complete levels, which is accomplished by eliminating all viruses from the playing field. A game over occurs if capsules fill up the playing field in a way that obstructs the bottle's narrow neck.<br><br>Email : q2tstudio.game@gmail.com<br>FB: https://www.facebook.com/pixelclassic/</div>"	"0.00"	"Music"	"600"

"com.jahjanuiceantara.syiiran_nadoman_basa_sunda"	"Lagu syiiran nadoman"	"10000"	"4.6"	"<div jsname=""sngebd"">berisi syiiran nadoman yang dapat menggugah kesadaran kita tentang hakikat kehidupan beragama kepada Allah, Sesama manusia, maupun Alam.Pupujian dalam bahasa Sunda suka disebut juga nadoman, yaitu untaian kata-kata yang terikat oleh padalisan (larik, baris) dan pada (bait). Kadang-kadang istilah pupujian dibedakan dengan istilah nadoman. Pupujian diartikan sebagai puisi yang isinya puja-puji kepada Allah, sedang nadoman diartikan sebagai puisi yang isinya mengenai ajaran keagamaan. Menurut Rusyana (1971: 9) isi pupujian itu terbagi menjadi enam golongan , yaitu :<br><br>1.      Memuji keagungan Tuhan,<br>2.      Sholawat kepada Rasulullah,<br>3.     Doa dan taubat kepada Allah,  <br>4.     Meminta safaat kepada Rasulullah,  <br>5.     Menasehati umat agar melakukan ibadat dan amal saleh serta menjauhi kemaksiatan,<br>6.      Memberi pelajaran tentang agama, seperti keimanan, rukun Islam, fikih, akhlak, tarikh, tafsir Alquran, dan sorof.<br>Dilihat dari segi fungsinya, syiiran nadoman itu memiliki dua fungsi, yaitu fungsi ekspresi pribadi dan fungsi sosial Rusyana, 1971: 7). Fungsi sosial puisi pupujian sangat menonjol dibandingkan dengan fungsi ekspresi pribadi. Puisi pupujian dipakai untuk mempengaruhi pikiran, perasaan, dan tingkah laku manusia, selain digunakan untuk menyampaikan berbagai ajaran agama. Sebagai media pendidikan, puisi pupujian disampaikan dengan cara dinyanyikan yang dihafalkan di luar kepala. Dengan cara seperti itu, anak didik dan masyarakat akan tergugah dan mempunyai keinginan untuk mengikuti nasihat serta ajaran agama yang dikumandangkan melalui puisi pupujian itu. Rekan-rekan Guru yang mencintai sastra daerah! Dahulu pada masa-masa sebelum Perang Dunia II, puisi pupujian sering dikumandangkan di lingkungan pesantren dan madrasah, mesjid, langgar, ataupun tempat-tempat pengajian lainnya.<br><br>syiiran nadoman ini dialunkan pada saat-saat menjelang salat subuh, magrib, dan isya. Pada masa sekarang ini frekuensi pemakaian puisi pupujian di tempat-tempat tersebut itu sudah agak berkurang, sekalipun masih ada, tetapi fungsinya sudah berubah. Kalau sebelumnya diutamakan menjadi media pendidikan, sekarang menjadi salah satu ajang kegiatan kesenian yang bersifat seremonial saja. Misalnya hanya dipakai pada acara kesenian dalam kegaiatan memperingati Maulud Nabi, Rajaban, musabaqoh tilawatil Quran, atau intihan. Akan tetapi di madrasah-madrasah, walaupun dalam jumlah yang relatif kecil, puisi pupujian ini masih tetap berfungsi sebagai media pendidikan untuk mempermudah penyampaian ajaran agama Islam kepada anak-anak. Ada indikasi bahwa berkurangnya pemakaian puisi pupujian itu disebabkan oleh tingkat pengetahuan dan pendidikan agama masyarakat sekarang sudah jauh lebih tinggi daripada ajaran-ajaran agama yang tertuang dalam puisi pupuian. Selain itu, buku-buku tentang ajaran agama Islam sekarang telah banyak beredar dan mudah diperoleh. Mungkin juga karena pengaruh kebudayaan modern, sehingga masyarakat sekarang menganggap bahwa lagu dan ajaran Islam dalam puisi pupujian sudah kurang relevan dengan tuntutan perkembangan zaman, terutama ajaran adab dan sopan santun. semoga bermanfaat</div>"	"0.00"	"Music"	"469"

Note Rush is great for teaching keyboard geography by making sure each note is played in the correct octave.

See noterushapp.com/troubleshooting for help. ***<br><br>Listens to Your Instrument<br>------------------------------<br>Note Rush helps students learn a strong association between notes on the page and keys on your instrument by using your device's microphone to detect when you play each note. Works with pianos, keyboards, flutes, violins, you name it! (See Q&amp;A below for more about supported instruments.)<br><br>Student-paced<br>------------------<br>Note Rush goes as fast or as slow as the student with no time limits, so is suitable for complete beginners right through to being a fun challenge for professionals!<br><br>Grand Staff Context<br>-----------------------<br>The whole grand staff is always visible, showing each note in full context and helping students learn how notes are spaced out across the two staves.<br><br>Octave-Sensitive Keyboard Geography<br>---------------------------------------------<br>It's a ""B"", but which ""B""?? Note Rush teaches keyboard geography by making sure you're getting the note in the right octave every time.<br><br>Great for Home Practise<br>------------------------------<br>Students will rush to their instrument at home every day with NoteRush, chasing that elusive high score! Unlike flashcards, children can drill note identification at home with no music-reading parent required to check if they're getting them correct - Note Rush checks for you! Play every day and you'll soon be able to name and identify notes instantly!<br><br>Fifteen Levels or Make Your Own!<br>-------<br>Note Rush has fifteen built-in Levels, from Middle C-Position right through to the full grand staff with 2 ledger lines above and below.

Teachers can select notes for a student then send their custom level as a Level Card via Email or Text Message for the student to open on their device.<br><br>Better Than Flash Cards!<br>-------------------------<br>Use Note Rush instead of printed flash cards! Note Rush was designed to replace the cards used in One Minute Club - a challenge you can run in your studio where students have to complete a given level in under a minute. Give it a try!<br><br>Having trouble?

"com.webruli.flutcal"	"Real Flute Play"	"5000"	"3.1"	"<div jsname=""sngebd"">The word flute first entered the English language during the Middle English period, as floute,[4] or else flowte, flo(y)te,[5] possibly from Old French flaute and from Old Provençal flaüt,[4] or else from Old French fleüte, flaüte, flahute via Middle High German floite or Dutch fluit. The English verb flout has the same linguistic root, and the modern Dutch verb fluiten still shares the two meanings.[6] Attempts to trace the word back to the Latin flare (to blow, inflate) have been pronounced ""phonologically impossible"" or ""inadmissable"".[5] The first known use of the word flute was in the 14th century.[7] According to the Oxford English Dictionary, this was in Geoffrey Chaucer's The Hous of Fame, c.1380.[5]<br><br>Today, a musician who plays any instrument in the flute family can be called a flutist (pronounced ""FLEW-tist"", most common in the US),[8] or flautist (pronounced ""FLAW-tist"", most common in the UK),[9] or simply a flute player (more neutrally). Flutist dates back to at least 1603, the earliest quote cited by the Oxford English Dictionary. Flautist was used in 1860 by Nathaniel Hawthorne in The Marble Faun, after being adopted during the 18th century from Italy (flautista, itself from flauto), like many musical terms in England since the Italian Renaissance. Other English terms, now virtually obsolete, are fluter (15th–19th centuries)[10][11][12] and flutenist (17th–18th centuries).[6][13]<br><br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flute</div>"	"0.00"	"Music"	"41"
"com.webruli.guitar"	"My Guitar"	"1000"	"4.1"	"<div jsname=""sngebd"">The guitar is a popular musical instrument classified as a string instrument with anywhere from 4 to 18 strings, usually having 6. The sound is projected either acoustically or through electrical amplification (for an acoustic guitar or an electric guitar, respectively). It is typically played by strumming or plucking the strings with the right hand while fretting (or pressing against the frets) the strings with the fingers of the left hand. The guitar is a type of chordophone, traditionally constructed from wood and strung with either gut, nylon or steel strings and distinguished from other chordophones by its construction and tuning. The modern guitar was preceded by the gittern, the vihuela, the four-course Renaissance guitar, and the five-course baroque guitar, all of which contributed to the development of the modern six-string instrument.<br><br>There are three main types of modern acoustic guitar: the classical guitar (nylon-string guitar), the steel-string acoustic guitar, and the archtop guitar. The tone of an acoustic guitar is produced by the strings's vibration, amplified by the body of the guitar, which acts as a resonating chamber. The classical guitar is often played as a solo instrument using a comprehensive finger-picking technique. The term ""finger-picking"" can also refer to a specific tradition of folk, blues, bluegrass, and country guitar playing in the United States.<br><br>Electric guitars, introduced in the 1930s, use an amplifier that can electronically manipulate and shape the tone. Early amplified guitars employed a hollow body, but a solid body was eventually found more suitable, as it was less prone to feedback. Electric guitars have had a continuing profound influence on popular culture.<br><br>The guitar is used in a wide variety of musical genres worldwide. It is recognized as a primary instrument in genres such as blues, bluegrass, country, flamenco, folk, jazz, jota, mariachi, metal, punk, reggae, rock, soul, and many forms of pop.</div>"	"0.00"	"Music"	"14"
