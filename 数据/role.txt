"com.avalon.cave"	"The Greedy Cave"	"1000000"	"4.2"	"<div jsname=""sngebd"">In a land far, far away there once was a vast continent called Milton. It was a land where the power of rule came by the sword and the arcane, where Men who devoted themselves to the blade or to magecraft, could become the finest warriors, wisest wizards or the greatest adventurers. In this land, there are several kingdoms divided by borders but united through history. Countless stories of alliances, upheaval, and moments of peace bedeck this tapestry, but that is a tale for another day. <br><br>Our story begins in a remote kingdom to the north, Iblis, an obscure and oft-forgotten place. It is a wild and barren land, a place where its people scrape a living from the earth, mining minerals for the lords of the south. On occasion, adventurers would stop by for the night but never linger. Until one day, a fledgling adventurer lost his way and stumbled into a hole. The story might have ended then had he not come back, but return he did, with sacks of gold and glittering treasure. <br><br>Like a fierce gale from the north, news of his fame and fortune fanned across the kingdoms overnight, and kings sent their bravest warriors and adventurers to clear the cavern of monsters in search of treasure. Even peasants wanting a part of this newfound wealth partook in these expeditions. In no time at all, a bustling town had sprung up in this forgotten place. People set up camps, and formed their own groups to explore the cave. Clever merchants not missing this opportunity, built taverns and shops near the cave, selling equipment and potions to eager adventurers. At first everything seemed fine. As explorers delved into the caves, they encountered new creatures and discovered new treasures. Mysteries continued to poured forth from the cave, yet nobody knew where the source of the secrets lay. However, as the explorations continued, the balance of wealth beyond the cave began to waver, and cracks appeared among those adventurers who had previously worked arm-in-arm. The latecomers or weak, limited to wandering the upper levels of the cave, could only watch as the veteran adventurers brought treasure after treasure from the deep. They began harboring dark thoughts as they watched the veteran adventurers grow arrogant from their largesse, ordering people around, hoarding secrets from the rest. The place became a festering pool of suspicions and greed, mired in jealous rage. <br><br>It started with an adventurer disappearing in the cave. Rumors circulated he had found some legendary treasure and hoarded it for himself. Others said he had been guided to another world by some mysterious magic force in the cave. Still the unspoken belief was that he had been murdered by a rival party and was buried somewhere beneath the caverns. Nobody knows exactly what happened, but people have continued to disappear ever since. As more people have gone missing, some adventurers have called it quits, others cling to hope, and a few continue to wait and see. Which brings us to you, an ordinary young man, coming into this extraordinary circumstance with purposes unknown to others.

Adventurers came in flocks with their respective goals. This unprecedented adventuring fever directly caused some kingdoms to prosper, while others withered and died, leading to the change in the geopolitical landscape of the world.<br>However, it was too late when people discovered the truth. When the conspiracy was revealed, the army of demons has already descended upon the realm, the gods were furious; both heaven and earth lost its colors. War rapidly spreads to all corners of the land, no one was spared. Humans were as helpless as dust blown against the flames of war. Homes were ravaged; civilizations destroyed, the world took on an unprecedentedly heavy toll, as only a few survivors eventually remained. This catastrophe lasted for many years until people almost forgot the name of this continent—Milton.<br>This story easily reminds people of what happened recently. Thousands of years later, in Basatan, a magic worshipping kingdom embraced by mountains, its sorcerers claimed that they have opened the door to another world through their research. A place where time-interlaced with space, where you can see not only images of the old world, but also many bizarre creatures that people have never heard of before. However, as they have said before, ""the way to control this power has not been found yet, thus you do not know where you will end up.""<br>Obviously, such minor issues could not possibly stop people's curiosity. As if yesterday once more, the adventurers of different kingdoms gathered again today, and the second ""Gold Rush"" inevitably started…<br><br>Follow us:<br>Facebook: @GreedyCave2</div>"	"0.00"	"Role Playing"	"3371"

"com.burpsgames.battlewizardattack"	"Battle Wizard Attack"	"10000"	"4.3"	"<div jsname=""sngebd"">Battle Wizard Attack is a retro style hack-and-slash game, where you have to defeat endless respawning hordes of skeletons with your magic powers.<br><br>Hack-and-slash game behavior:<br>You control one single battle wizard and walk around quickly; having to kill every monster you come across. The game has a simplified attribute and skill system where you gain experience from killing monsters and when you've got enough experience you'll level up. When you level up you can spend two points per level on the three categories LIFE, MANA or DAMAGE. LIFE increases your character's lifepoints. You lose lifepoints if you get hit by an enemy. Note: When you lose all of your lifepoints the game is over and you need to revive your character.<br><br>8-Bit-Retro-Style:<br>The graphics are old-school to look like the popular old handheld games. I think a good game concept doesn't need high class 3D graphics and I really love pixel art.<br><br>Touch/Tablet/Phone optimised:<br>Use the controll cross to move your character. The auto-aim-function helps you to shoot always to the right direction.<br><br>Less talking more action:<br>This game looks like an RPG but it really is an ultimate ACTION RPG. You won't find characters (NPCs) to talk to. It is all about action.<br><br>No pay-to-win (EVER):<br>I really dislike pay-to-win. If players can ""buy"" an advantage I think it is not a game anymore. For me a game is a set of rules where each player has a common goal and an equal chance to win. I will not let anything ruin this. Also I want to reach as many players as possible. Therefore the game is free.  In the future we might integrate design based in-app-purchases. So you may be able to buy more fancy dresses or more pets but those features will never have an influence on the game rules or outcomes. <br><br>User-based game development:<br>I am listening to your feedback. Let me know if you have any nice ideas to improve the game. Good ratings pushes my speed of development.<br><br>Thank you for reading and enjoy the game :-)</div>"	"0.00"	"Role Playing"	"591"

"com.consideredhamster.yetanotherpixeldungeon"	"Yet Another Pixel Dungeon"	"500000"	"4.5"	"<div jsname=""sngebd""><b>Yet Another Pixel Dungeon</b> (or YetAnotherPD for short) is a roguelike RPG with pixel graphics and simple controls. Like most other games in this genre, it features randomly generated levels, relatively high difficulty and a large number of things to learn. And like most other games of its genre, it is quite challenging.<br><br>This game is based on the source code of another Android game, <b>Pixel Dungeon</b>. It began as a small project with the goal to improve the original game here or there, but has since gradually grown into something much, much bigger. The games are quite different from each other, so there is no need to play the original game before trying this one (but I would recommend to try it as well, it's good).<br><br>The main feature of <b>YetAnotherPD</b> which makes it different from original game and other mods is that it is mostly focused on tweaking game mechanics in order to make the game more interesting, diverse and balanced. Anyone who is familiar with the original game will have much to learn again in YAPD.<br><br>The features of this mod at this point:<br><br>- Four <b>character classes</b> were reworked and now have different strengths and weaknesses<br><br>- Four difficulty variants, to provide adequate challenge for every type of a player<br><br>- A variety of equipment options - <b>dual wielding, firearms, shields, and more</b>!<br><br>- <b>Most enchantments on the weapons and armor</b> now are more powerful than before<br><br>- <b>Environment now affects stealth and evasion</b>, encouraging a more tactical approach<br><br>- <b>All bosses have been completely or partially reworked</b> and are now even more epic!<br><br>- <b>New items, enemies, traps, and interactions</b> added between them!<br><br>- <b>Loading tips and more detailed information</b> about items and character stats<br><br>- <b>Improved user interface</b> - auto-aiming, extended journal and other stuff<br><br>- Both new and modified potions, scrolls, wands, rings and other items...<br><br>- Healing, stealth, wand usage and item durability systems were reworked!<br><br>- Many old enemies gained new abilities or were moved to other parts of the dungeon<br><br>- Each chapter now contains six floors (a total of 31 floor dungeon instead of 26)<br><br>- Shops are now on every fifth level, and their assortment has become more varied<br><br>- Even more features are coming later since this project is still in development!<br><br>*****<br><br>YetAnotherPD is absolutely, totally and completely <b>free</b>. There are no advertisements, microtransactions or limited access, and will never be. Even the “donate” button was only added much later after the main release.<br><br>Of important notes: first, this mod keeps degradation system from original game, but it was reworked to be <i>much</i> more fair and adequate. It also limits item upgrades to a maximum of +3, but do not fear as <i>everything</i> was rebalanced accordingly. These features are inherent to the game system now and they will <i>not</i> be removed.<br><br>As a second important note, mind that subclasses, unique class armors, Lloyd's Beacon and Dew Vial were removed from the game. Some of these things were reworked into something different (Dew Vial, unique class armors), while other are gonna be brought back later (subclasses, Lloyd's Beacon).<br><br>This project is the product of open source software under GPLv3 License. You can find the source code for the current version here: https://github.com/ConsideredHamster/YetAnotherPixelDungeon<br><br>There are lots of changes in this mod, so it is highly recommended to check its Pixel Dungeon wikia article to avoid initial confusion: http://pixeldungeon.wikia.com/wiki/Mod-Yet_Another_Pixel_Dungeon<br><br>Finally, I want to say that I am open to suggestions and bug reports and always happy to hear your opinion about my project, whatever it is. My reddit account is here:https://www.reddit.com/user/ConsideredHamster/<br><br>A special thanks to everyone who supported this little project one way or another ;)<br><br>I wish good luck to all fellow rat punchers and demon slayers out there!</div>"	"0.00"	"Role Playing"	"4246"

This mod currently adds a tutorial and a map editor feature. Maps can be exported to/imported from a public folder called YourPD. When connected to a computer you can copy the files in the folder to send to other people, and put other peoples' maps on your own phone (if you have downloaded any and placed on your phone).<br><br>Main Contributors: Eric Britsman, Özgür Tanriverdi &amp; Anton Grönlund<br><br>see also: http://pixeldungeon.wikia.com/wiki/Thread:25535 &amp; http://www.reddit.com/r/PixelDungeon/comments/2sefhv/your_pixel_dungeon_v095_quickslots_key_rings/<br><br>License information can be found here: gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html<br><br>Our source code can be found here: https://github.com/QuattroX/pixel-dungeon<br><br>The original game can be found here: play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.watabou.pixeldungeon<br>The original source code can be found here: https://github.com/watabou/pixel-dungeon<br><br>Please feel free to leave a review, any feedback is much appreciated!<br><br>GENERAL TIPS<br>The game uses autosave (so don't worry about how to save manually). The save for a character is deleted if the character dies.<br><br>MAP EDITOR TIPS<br>You can scroll up/down in the map editor views.<br><br>You can have max 10 custom dungeons (with any amount of depths). Longclick on a file in the first page of map editor to access the file delete dialog. <br><br>The tabs in the second page of the map editor are scrollable, you may need to scroll a bit to access and modify a certain depth. <br><br>If a floor tab is long-pressed, the delete dialog for the tab (and that floor in the map) can be accessed. Due to a bug if you delete floor 1 when only 2 floors are left and floor 1 is selected, you will need to go out of the tabs view and reselect the map you were editing (to force refresh UI).<br><br>You will automatically get a ""finish"" screen when descending the last staircase in your custom dungeon.<br><br>If you want the player to start at a certain level with certain items, the best solution right now is to have your first depth be mob-free, then add items and experience potions as needed to depth 1 then have the ""real start"" be from depth 2.<br><br>The game's wiki has information about all items, mobs, rooms etc : pixeldungeon.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page <br><br>MAP EDITOR LIMITATIONS<br>Depths are generated based on the custom settings, but the layout of each depth will always be random (you will find everything you have specified, but it will be in a different place on the depth each time).<br><br>Boss type depths can only be modified with items (and always contain the ""correct"" boss).<br><br>Rooms can currently not be modified. As such, Shop room is not selectable since the items in it is based on ""standard"" 25 floor dungeon logic.<br><br>Sign contents/placement is not currently supported.<br><br>Quests are not currently supported.<br><br>Cannot set starting level/equipment of the player character.<br><br>//YourPD team</div>"	"0.00"	"Role Playing"	"9044"

Terrifying monsters and countless traps stand in your way. Infinite eerie Labyrinths filled with terrifying monsters and countless traps to snare Adventurers. Your destiny is in your hands! Never far behind are the deadly battles and the creeping fear of being trapped alive. Take on Labyrinths with your own mighty party! Collect and train characters, build your own mighty party, modify items you find, and take on Labyrinths! <br><br>A new nostalgic experience is here! <br><br>There was a time when mad kings and grand wizards feuded over magical artifacts. A time when stories of dragons and their lust for treasure were not stories at all. <br>That is, until they faded into legend, and the Kingdom of Ardéme was born. Yet the road to prosperity is fraught with strife – a foul mist swept across the land. Its rotten reach was not boundless, however. An endless source of divine protection was found flowing from a single sacred cup: Holy Water. Nevertheless, the kingdom's demise was sealed when King Arthurus' closest confidant, Grand Sorcerer Ambrosius, was bitten by a vampire lord and fled the land with the holy cup in hand, never to be seen again.	<br>With the fall of the once-mighty realm, the Miasma ravaged the land without mercy. Ardéme became a desolate uninhabitable terrain, and with nothing to keep its evil in check, the malevolence reached neighboring Camrone. Ardéme's heir to the throne, the young Prince Danjaq, was granted refuge by Camrone's ruler, Duke Baudricourt. Dreaming year upon year of reclaiming the cup, when the moment came to face Ambrosius, he met the same fate as his father.<br>The Miasma grew denser, hungrier, and more powerful by the day, gushing forth from countless mysterious Labyrinths littered across the land. Baudricourt, resolved to see an end to the crisis, assembled a force to investigate.

Справитесь ли вы с особым пойлом трактирщика?<br>- Встретьтесь со знаменитыми пиратами Морганом Кровавым и Чёрной Бородой.<br>- Десятки морских чудовищ, призраков, демонов и прочих потусторонних тварей могут стать вашими врагами или союзниками.<br><br>Готовы отправиться в увлекательное плавание на корабле, которое захватит вас своей опасностью и приключениями? Заработайте славу, и каждый матрос захочет присоединиться к вам в этом непростом путешествии. Будьте готовы к тому, что вам придется не раз надорвать спину, перетаскивая тяжелые мешки в попытке заработать на собственное судно. Но разве это имеет смысл, когда на горизонте маячит остров сокровищ, посетить который вы мечтали с самого детства? Правда, ожидание бывает слишком утомительным, а потому, когда сама судьба натолкнет вас на возможность получить мешок звонких монет, будет непросто устоять перед соблазном. <br><br>Водрузите черный флаг на мачту своего судна и отправьтесь на поиск сокровищ, которые манят своим чарующим блеском каждого искателя приключений. Но будьте осторожны, ведь на вашем пути могут возникнуть препятствия, которые поставят под сомнение успех вашего путешествия. Сумеете ли вы спасти свою команду от охотников на пиратов и болезней? Убережете ли пиратский корабль? Готовы ли вы отдать накопленное золото за спасение или предпочтете принять корабельный бой? Вот только никогда не забывайте, что порой стоит отступить, чтобы затем, набрав сил, вернуться и нанести ответный удар неприятелю. <br><br>Эта игра про пиратов заставит вас почувствовать себя отважным капитаном, который не боится ни опасностей моря, ни тех тварей, что скрывает водная толща от ваших глаз. Однако не торопитесь рубить с плеча, ведь самый страшный монстр может оказаться верным другом. <br><br>Текстовый квест позволит вам погрузиться в атмосферу восемнадцатого века. Побудьте на месте юнца, который родился в испанском городке под названием Тихий. Исследование морей, которыми грезил каждый авантюрист еще с раннего детства, принесет вам не немало сюрпризов. Отправляя матроса на дно, вы можете потерять ценного члена команды. Однако, если удача будет на вашей стороне, вам удастся отыскать сокровище пиратов, которое, помимо монет, принесет вам немало славы. Вот только не стоит забывать, что вокруг есть много желающих добраться до ваших богатств, а потому вы не сможете устоять перед соблазном закопать клад. Эта предусмотрительность спасала не одного пирата, и будьте уверены, что следующая битва на море не коснется запаса ваших драгоценных монет. <br><br>Как капитан корабля, вы несете ответственность за свое судно и команду, и лишь от ваших решений зависит, каким будет исход этого путешествия. Если сражение на кораблях настигнет вас, будьте готовы принять сложный выбор. Что вы предпочтете - потерять команду или разрушить корабль? А может, решитесь отказаться от золота? <br><br>Приключения пиратов зачастую будут заводить вас в самую гущу событий, заставляя ежеминутно рисковать не только собственным имуществом, но и головой. А потому вам просто необходимо место, где вы сможете восстановить свои силы. Этот симулятор пирата позволит вам построить собственную таверну. И хотя она будет радовать не только внешним убранством, но и доходом, пиратство у вас в крови, а потому вы вновь отправитесь в плавание, в котором вас ждут морские битвы, горы золота и незабываемые приключения!</div>"	"0.00"	"Role Playing"	"188"

Plan, build, craft, fight and explore the world. Don't be fooled by simple graphics – you'll find a challenge for both fans of classic role-playing games and TBS strategies.<br><br><b>☑ Exploration</b><br>Explore the map of The Everwoods. The mountains are rich in gold and sapphires. Fertile fields provide grasses and food. Dense forests are ripe with wood and precious acorns. Scorching deserts are rich in valuable sand. Everywhere there are secrets to attract an experienced adventurer...<br><br><b>☑ City-builder</b><br>Restore an abandoned town – the ruins of an ancient civilization. This may not be as big as in classic turn-based strategy and role-playing games, but it’s perfect for unhurried gameplay on the touchscreen :)<br><br><b>☑ Battle</b><br>The local inhabitants you'll encounter are not happy with their new neighbors. To battle them, you will need weapons and magic potions. You will need to craft these in the workshop according to ancient recipes.<br><br><b>☑ Craft</b><br>Improvise to make your first simple tools, then progress to crafting more complex tools to ensure your survival in the wilds of The Everwoods.<br><br><b>☑ Turn based tactics</b><br>The game will become progressively more difficult – you will face new enemies, while the old ones remain familiar and safe. As in any RPG or strategies, you'll level up your griblers through building the town. As they level up, your griblers gain new skills and improve their strengths. Very often you will have to think 10 moves ahead – stave off danger from Squashy, lead Croxy, explore the fog of war with Rusty...<br><br><b>☑ Random events</b><br>Random events make the gaming experience more diverse – you may run into a sudden treasure chest or even an old witch. If you're lucky, you might even find seven-league boots. But not everyone has this much luck...<br><br><b>☑ Original Setting</b><br>Griblers are unusual creatures, mushroom trolls, who are indigenous inhabitants of an area called The Everwoods. We did not copy tired, classic fantasy with dwarves and elves. Instead, you will plunge into a new world with unique characters, funny dialog and unusual gameplay.<br> <br><b>★And the most important thing...★</b><br> <br><b>☑ Simple funny pet project</b><br>Griblers is a pet project, not aimed at getting money out of players. The gameplay is built in a way to make you enjoy the RPG/strategy game, without having to watch the same ad a hundred times for things you don’t really need. <br> <br>★★★<b>So, are you ready for an adventure?<b></b>★★★<br><i>Spring comes in The Everwoods, and griblers Croxy, Squashy, and Rusty decide to go back to their ancient homeland.

Other languages will be added, but we are a tiny company with a very large game).<br><br>Vendetta Online is a free, graphically intensive and cross-platform MMORPG set in space. Players take the role of spaceship pilots in a vast, persistent online galaxy. Trade between stations and build an empire, or pirate traders who dare to pursue routes through areas of lawless space. Fight other players, or cooperate with friends to push back the mysterious Hive. Mine ores and minerals, gather resources, and craft unusual items. Join the military of your nation, and participate in massive online battles (see the trailer). A wide variety of gameplay styles are available, from the the intensity of huge battles and realtime PvP, to the low-key enjoyment of quiet trading and mining in less dangerous areas of the galaxy. Play the style of game that suits you, or that suits your current mood. The availability of relatively casual and short-term goals allows for fun when only a little time is available to play.<br><br>Vendetta Online is free-to-play on Android, up to a level cap. An optional low subscription cost of only $1 per month allows unified access across all available platforms (including PC, Win/Mac/Linux). The Android version includes several helpful features:<br><br>- Single-Player mode: after completing the tutorial, a single-player sandbox sector becomes available, letting you perfect your flying technique and enjoy minigames while offline. This feature will be expanded in future patches, and will permanently be available to anyone with the game installed. Enjoy!<br>- Game controllers, TV Mode: use your favorite gamepad to play, Moga, Nyko, PS3, Xbox, Logitech and others. Gamepad-oriented ""TV Mode"" is enabled on micro-console and set-top box devices like AndroidTV.<br>- Keyboard and Mouse support (no FPS-style mouse on Android).<br><br>Additionally, be aware of the following:<br><br>- Free download, no strings attached.. find out if the game is for you.<br>- Seamlessly switch between mobile and PC! Play the game on your Mac, Windows, or Linux machine when at home. Single universe for all platforms.<br><br>System Requirements:<br><br>- Dual-core 1Ghz+ ARMv7 device, running a minimum of Android 2.3. We recommend Tegra4, Adreno 320+, Mali T6 and PowerVR Series 6 GPUs.<br>- 500MB of free SD space recommended. The game uses about 350MB, but patches itself, so additional free space is advised.<br>- 512MB device RAM minimum, 1GB recommended. This is a graphically intensive game! Anything less may experience force-closes, and is at your own risk.<br>- We suggest installing over Wifi (for the large download), but playing the game should use relatively little bandwidth, and works well over most 3G networks. You are responsible for monitoring your own bandwidth usage.<br>- If you experience a problem, please post to our forums so we can get more information from you. We fix issues as soon as possible, but we simply do not have *every* phone.<br>- Vendetta Online is MOGA Enhanced! Available at major US retailers and online at http://www.powera.com/moga<br><br>Caveats and Additional Information:<br><br>- The hardware intensity of this game often exposes device driver issues that remain hidden with other apps. If your device itself crashes and reboots, it is a driver bug! Not the game!<br>- This is a large and complex game, a true PC-style MMO. Do not expect a ""mobile"" game experience. If you take a little time to read the tutorials, you will succeed at the game much more quickly.<br>- The tablet and handset flight interfaces may take a little time to learn, although they are effective with some experience. The flight UI will be continually improved as we receive user feedback. Keyboard play can also be very effective (Asus Transformer, etc).<br>- We are a continually evolving game, often with patches released weekly. Our users are encouraged to help the game development process by posting to the Suggestions and Android forums of our website.</div>"	"0.00"	"Role Playing"	"16301"

The level cap usually takes weeks or months to reach, and is not as relevant to gameplay as actual player-skill. An optional $1/month subscription also allows play on PC.<br><br>- This is a full-blown PC MMORPG, live and continuously updated since 2002. This is not an over-simplified ""mobile"" game, and it has tremendous depth. Expect it to be a constantly evolving journey, not a game to be fully ""learned"" in one sitting.<br><br>System Requirements and Notes:<br><br>- 500MB of free storage space is recommended.<br><br>- Installing over Wifi is suggested. Gameplay may also be affected by mobile network quality.<br><br>- Vendetta Online is one of the most hardware-intensive mobile games ever created. If you experience device problems (device reboots, lockups), please contact us to let us know, but be aware that these are actually not bugs with the game itself! Rather, the game is showing bugs in hardware drivers and firmware. We try to work with device manufacturers to push them to test their products more intensively, to avoid these kinds of problems.</div>"	"2.99"	"Role Playing"	"53"

Two of these creatures, humans and demons, have been struggling against each other for many years. As the centuries passed, control shifted from demons to humans and back again. The humans finally earned a clear victory after the First Neverland War. But this left the country in ruins and led directly to the Second Neverland War, which saw the decisive victory of the demons once again.<br><br>Magic Age 1053—<br><br>Tragedy strikes the small woodland village of Petun—the town is attacked and burned to the ground by vicious Neverland troops. But Petun is only the first of many massacres; the Demon Army tears through every human village it can find, slaughtering the people as it goes. Humiliated and infuriated by these abuses, the humans begin to resist and fight back.<br><br>It starts as a rash of disorganized, sporadic riots. But it soon grows into something more, something meaningful. These uprisings become a beacon of hope to all humans, spurring them on to unite and form a new empire. They choose a name to reflect their most noble traditions, to reflect a time when they ruled over the demon horde. They call it the Reformed Simba Empire.<br><br>Petun—little more than a bump in the road, a mark on a map. But this is where it all started, where the undercurrent of disdain and hatred overflowed into a bloody torrent of death and destruction, drowning Neverland in war for years to come.<br><br>This is where our story begins—the story of the Seven Year War.<br><br>- Visit our website and forum at http://www.hyperdevbox.com for more FAQ and information.<br><br>©2011-2015 IDEA FACTORY, developed for Android, licensed and published by HYPERDEVBOX .</div>"	"10.99"	"Role Playing"	"4197"

"com.imago.partia"	"Partia 2"	"1000"	"4.5"	"<div jsname=""sngebd"">Partia 2 is a SRPG (Strategy RPG) video game inspired by SNES and Playstation SRPG games. In a high fantasy setting, the game will take players through an adventure where magic and sword collide and friendship and betrayal intertwine.<br><br>Partia 2 : The Pretenders War is a sequel to Partia: The Broken Lineage. The game packs 22 stages that could present challenges to any SRPG fan.<br><br>Partia 2 introduces many new features, including the choice of ""Common turn"" rule where all factions make moves alternatively (like Chess) instead of taking turns to move all his/her units. I believe this will bring a new nuance to gameplay if a player choose to do so. It can be toggled in intermission, and you can always play the game in the traditional turn based way. AI had improved a lot, and horse units now can move after attacking, if they have remaining move distances. <br><br>Regrettably, the game could not deliver large animation battle. If you felt the game looked bad in Partia 1, then you'll find this game look much the same, except we have much bigger and nicer character portraits. It is because original Partia was never profitable, making Partia 2 production running on fume. (It sold around 6000 copies in two years) The stress of not getting paid almost broke our team of two, but somehow sheer will allowed this game to be out here for you. So whether this game series is success or not, I am immensely proud of the results. How many five year projects can a person do in a life time? ;-) Many times I was tempted to include some IAP stuff into the game and get cheap dollar or two, but I decided against it. More than anything, I rather have this game to be remembered as good, than have that IAP distaste.<br><br>So you may refrain from purchasing this game if you didn't like Partia 1. But I promise you it will be a much better experience (and much more challenging) if you did enjoy the original Partia.<br><br>Thank you all, and please let us know what you think!</div>"	"5.99"	"Role Playing"	"127"

In this open-world, role-playing crime game you can be whoever you want, be it Bully, Businessman or Barbarian, so long as you’ve got the brains and bullets to back it up.<br><br>Torn City is so gritty and real that British Prime Minister Theresa May's staff used this game to learn about real criminal behaviour. Don't believe us? Google it. This genre-defining MMO RPG burst onto the scene in 2004 with its unique blend of old-school text-based action and immersive gritty content, and Torn's limitless, free-to-play virtual city continues to provide new experiences over a decade later.<br><br>Play TORN.com through this official app with push notifications and instant login functionality.<br><br>With a community of established opponents and 13 years of constant updates, new players can plug straight into a living, breathing RPG world complete with history, lore, rivalries and more.

Torn City is full of back-biting and drama, and whining will not be tolerated. You will be robbed. You will be shot. You will have flaming dog poop left at the front door of your mansion. If you're not ready to fight in the gutter and embrace chaos, we suggest you walk away now.<br><br>But if you think you've got what it takes then prepare yourself for a challenge, because every day is different, and on arrival you'll need to make friends and make them fast.

The third book can be accessed at the end of book 2. </b><br><br>Disclaimer: The game is only available in English. <br><br>Magium is a text adventure game similar to old Choose your own story books (CYOA), in which you play as an ordinary guy named Barry, who joins a deadly mage tournament against the most powerful mages in the world in the hopes of using the prize to fulfill his lifelong dream of becoming a mage himself.<br><br>As in all interactive novels, your choices will affect the story, and making wrong choices can even lead to your death. Besides the traditional choice making of regular Choose your own path games, Magium also has stats that you can upgrade with points that you will receive occasionally, throughout the game. These stats will be checked by the game from time to time, to see if they are high enough to allow you to perform certain actions. For example, if your ancient languages stat is high enough, you can understand what animals and monsters are saying.<br><br>The story of Magium starts at the beginning of the tournament, right after you and all the other participants were transported to the continent where the contest was taking place, and it is set in a medieval fantasy setting, with a dash of futuristic looking magical devices, which are relics of an ancient, technologically advanced civilization that crumbled hundreds of years before the beginning of the series. The world in which the story takes place is somewhat inspired from Dungeons and Dragons, so if you've played D&amp;D before, you will likely find some similarities, especially regarding the magic system.<br><br>As the story progresses, you will meet with other participants, you will make friends and enemies, and you will find out more about the continent you are on, and its inhabitants. You will find out that a person called ""The Creator"" had established several utopias in this place, six hundred years ago, where animals and humans lived in harmony, and food was created through magic. What you will get to see, however, is the downfall of these utopias, some of them being on the brink of destruction. Your choices will influence what happens in these cities, and you can even choose to save them if you so desire.<br><br>The game will be divided into six or seven books, each of them consisting of more than a hundred thousand words.<br><br>The first book is now available in its entirety, and it can be played for free, with ads. It is approximately 178k words long, which translates to about 700 book pages. This number also takes into account the story's branching paths. The length of a playthrough on average should be about 90k words, so about 350 book pages.<br><br>The second book is now available in its entirety, but the next books have not been written yet, and they will be published chapter by chapter, as I write them. Unlike the first book, the second one will need to be unlocked before it can be played, and it will be the same for the next books as well. In order to unlock the second book, you will either need to complete 25 of the 35 available achievements, or pay to remove the ads for the first book.<br><br>The second book is 277k words in total, on all paths, which translates to about 1100 book pages. On one path, you should be seeing around half of those words, so roughly 140k, which would translate to 550 book pages or so.  <br><br>If you want to be notified about the game's updates, you can follow Magium Games on twitter by following this link: https://twitter.com/Magium_games or if you prefer to use Facebook for your updates, you can also follow the game's Facebook page at this link: https://www.facebook.com/Magium-Games-1933559536878087/<br><br>Credits for the game icon go to Agnes Landgraf.</div>"	"0.00"	"Role Playing"	"39333"

Each quest is different, and with so many class combinations, it could take forever to discover everything about this roguelike RPG.<br><br>PLAY YOUR WAY: The multi-classing system adds to the replayability by allowing you to choose from 2 to 6 classes from over two dozen different choices that range from ordinary warriors, holy clerics, nature-loving druids, lightning-wielding storm mages and zombie-summoning necromancers.  <br><br>STRATEGIC TURN-BASED COMBAT:  Use tactics to surround an enemy to gain attack bonuses, stay near your comrades to boost your defense, and be aware of staying in one place too long else you might attract attention.  The tactical combat system is designed to make you think before you seperate.<br><br>DON'T BE AFRAID TO RUN: In true roguelike fashion, death is permanent, but only if your friends can't bandage you in time.  Not every adventure will work out, so don't be afraid to run back to the entrance.  <br><br>FAILURE HAS CONSEQUENCES: Not every quest will wait for your second, third or fourth attempt.  Some grow harder, some are solved by other heroes, and some have direct consequences for failure.<br><br>LEVELS AND ITEMS AND ABILITIES OH MY!  Adventure through twenty levels of multi-classing fun with hundreds of items and fun abilities like dual-wielding, ranged combat, devastating spells, summoned allies and terrain-modifying rituals like flaming walls and freezing mists.<br><br>ADVENTURE YOUR WAY: This roguelike adventure is all about personal choice from how you build your character to which quests you choose to run.  Each city gets harder, and there's no going back to a previous city, so choose wisely when to move on and consider each quest before taking it on.<br><br>ROGUELIKE BY DESIGN: The roots of the game are in rogue-like games such as Rogue, Moria and Omega with randomly created areas and permadeath anchoring a robust role-playing game. While Moria expanded on Rogue, and Omega took the adventure outside, Endless Adventure takes the roguelike magic and aims it at quests.<br><br>THE TABLETOP WITHOUT THE TABLE: Endless Adventure is designed to feel like old tabletop pen-and-paper games with limited healing translating to a strategic element in getting through a mission.  You can't just rest at any time, so you must squeeze out every bit of tactics from battle to ensure you can make it through.<br><br>SPLIT YOUR PARTY.  One great aspect of a party-based rogue-like game is the ability to split the party into two groups to explore.  This goes hand-in-hand with some of the timed quests that don't give you forever to solve them. <br><br>DO IT OVER AGAIN! Break the maximum level with the generation system.  This allows you to start over with a character and gain an extra maximum level.</div>"	"0.99"	"Role Playing"	"12"

The game’s system is deep and versatile with only few fixed cornerstones, giving players lots of freedom over the content. From items and characters to skills and stats to whole adventure books and universes, everything is customizable. Despite its range of editing features, the game also remains very accessible to everyone who just wants to play a quick round. “No Pen, No Paper” facilitates the genre of pen and paper RPGs, by shifting the focus away from dull, extensive calculations and 500-page rulebooks to fast-paced, undistracted roleplaying. Players access their character sheet and the game log via an own mobile device while the game master leads them through the adventure, which can also be done via mobile, but a larger (touch) device is recommended. A physical 20-sided dice determines the fate of player and NPC characters alike.<br>The first universe created for the game is a fantasy universe called “The Golden Chronicles”, telling the story of its inhabitants – the Fey, the K’thar, and the Lynx. The provided adventure book within is called “Distortion”. It deals with topics such as systemic racism, alteration of the public perception, guilt, and forgiveness. While in structure it resembles usual starter-adventures, the narrative turns away from the more common black and white scheme. A simple quest turns out to be much more complex and blurred than previously assumed.<br>The current stage of development is a vertical slice in the form of an Android App / Windows PC build, that allows for the participation, creation, and management of play sessions.

There is something tempting in perspective to fight against the new strong competitors and to win the chance to touch Alterant. What if we tell you that you can earn fame and write down your name in the history of the times of heroes?<br><br>It may sound like a fiction story, but in a virtual world of free apps for Android, there are no any boundaries. And the PvP game Heroes of Alterant can take you away from reality to the fascinating fantasy world of adventures andmatch 3 RPG puzzle quest.<br><br>3 in a row and more challenges in action!<br><br>This game is based on the matching objects like jewels, gems or stones – not 2 but minimum 3 in a row. However, adding elements of PvP and MMORPG we have created an unique gaming space for true adventurers and mystery lovers. So what to expect? Be prepared for the following:<br><br>•	fighting online in real time with real competitors from all over the world to gain the victory on the Arena;<br>•	winning chests with new characters, spells, and elixirs;<br>•	take part in the free tournaments and events in order to get the exclusive heroes;<br>•	pass various challenges with bonuses and valuable rewards;<br>•	collect all the mighty heroes of war with unique powers and spells;<br>•	develop your own new winning tactics and achieve the name of the Arena Winner.<br><br>Are you a real fighter? Are you ready to compete online with others? Compose your own story!<br><br>Keep in mind that you cannot play offline here if there is no Wi-Fi, but this is the main point that makes Heroes of Alterant remarkable.<br><br>What are the main problems of the majority of match three games?<br><br>In most cases of games with tasks to match 3 objects in order to activate the spell and that is it. We have noticed that the mechanics of the “colored mana” do not bring the adventure experience and feeling of the battle. Three stones and gems often collected automatically without your control and the player does not feel like it is the achievement. The spells become available randomly. This makes impossible to select the best spell and to develop your own new gaming strategy as there is no chance to think through the few steps further. <br><br>Peculiarities of our 3-in-a-row app<br><br>The top feature that makes our app stands out of the crowd of the numerous match-3 games is that we focused the gameplay on spells. Matching mechanics serves here as an additional tool. Players get the mana at the beginning of every move and after the collection of blue stones (with bonuses). This helps to predict your behavior in the next moves. Every character has own unique spells and a full control over them.<br><br>Combining RPG and task to match three jewels we have saved the importance of every move and provided players with the opportunity to change their tactics. We tried to make every stone valuable. Your victory depends not only on spells, but also on how you use the gaming field and how well you are at matching three gems.<br><br>Who will enjoy this game?<br><br>Are you a fan of RPG games? Do you like puzzle quests and activities that make your brain burn, but still remain exciting and attractive? Are Match-3 games among your favorite ones? Guess what, we have created a perfect game for you! It will fulfill all your interests and thirst for the adventurers. This is the main trend of 2017-2018 - to combine and mix different genres and activities in order to provide you with the completely new level of entertainment.<br><br>Heroes of Alterant is the best both for kids and for adults. The challenging puzzle quests will make your child think and train the brain. Grown-ups enjoy it because it helps to space out of the real-world worries and become a hero of your own legend.<br><br>So do not waste your time and download this app for free.<br><br>Privacy Policy:<br>http://pralterant.cdnvideo.ru/site/privacy/privacy_en.html<br><br>Terms of Service:<br>https://pralterant.cdnvideo.ru/site/terms/terms_en.html<br><br>Have a nice day!</div>"	"0.00"	"Role Playing"	"8046"

These problems range from simple ""find a key"" to ""use magic powers to light all magic candles and open the magical gate"". Different types of quests require different solutions. Use the skills of the characters in your party to complete these quests. <br><br>Weapons - Your characters are your main weapons. The Elf shoots his arrows through multiple monsters, the Wizard has unlimited magic, the Warrior has a powerful melee attack with his hammer, and the Valkyrie besides having a quick spinning-melee attack can also detect secrets and important loot. The characters can level up to increase their firepower, or find rare loot which enhances your character for short periods of time. This includes magic spells! <br><br>Secrets - Find secret rooms, level-skipping teleports, secret items, and more! <br><br>Perma-items - You will be able to unlock magic spells by collecting 4 shards of various magic books. Once all shards are collected the magic is unlocked. It's also possible to increase the strength of this magic by collecting the magic shards multiple times.

Murk had managed to ward off two assaults from Wayward’s troops – one at the main gate and one by water, near Icewind Quay. Only when the morning light scattered the darkness did we see the price we had paid to survive that night: new cracks and holes in the thick city wall, a destroyed defensive tower, more homes reduced to rubble, and new fires throughout the city. At least a few dozen dead bodies laid scattered in the ashes, debris, and dust.<br><br>At nightfall, Wayward’s war drums began their rumble once again. The catapults were still silent, but they would undoubtedly start singing their deathly song soon. For nine days, Wayward’s hordes had sieged Murk, and every night the city walls groaned under the volleys of stones and fire hurled at them.</div>"	"4.99"	"Role Playing"	"18"

Dynamic Shadows have been added to all areas. Players have full control over the quality of the shadows through the options menu.<br><br>Legend and Eternal Legend Crafting - Our new Legend Crafting System allows you to Salvage your unwanted Legend and above items in return for Crafting Dust. If you have already unlocked a Legend item, you can now navigate to the LegendEx and create it for Dust. If you haven't unlocked the item, you'll be able to unlock creation of the Legend item with Dust! This provides a new way to target the Legend items you want while not being a slave to random chance.<br><br>Eternal Item Codex Tracking - Not only will you be able to create Legends item from the LegendEx in Patch 3.0, you'll also be able to create Eternal Legends from the brand new Eternal Tracking Section of the Codex.<br><br>Pet Crafting System - To facilitate customizing your pets a bit more, we've enabled the Diamond through Fluorite and Topaz crystals on Pets. The only difference is that these Crystals will consume 5 of each type instead of the usual 1 crystal.<br><br>Bug Fixes and System Adjustments:<br><br>Stat Change and Reset - Having near 300 stat points was always a bit tedious to assign and respec, so we've cut down the amount of stat points you gain per level from 3 to 1, and have tripled the effectiveness of each Stat. We've also improved the speed a bit of stat assigning.<br><br>Better Gold Purchase Value<br>THANK YOU for supporting Dungeon Quest and for helping us make even better games!

Once designed for high-pressure environments and exploring gas giants and deep space, these mechs have now been modified for war. <br><br>Templars descend from a Zendu bloodline -- a unique heritage that gives them the ability (with proper training and ritual) to pass all of memories from their lives (and any memories passed down by their ancestors) to a newborn child. This memory gift is known as a Templar’s Lineage – and it is what gives Templars their immense advantage in combat, tactics, engineering, and the ability to drive hulking Leviathan Battle Suits. You will take on the role of a Templar Captain who hails from a storied Lineage reaching back 87 Templars -- and who pages back through the memories to help cope with the dire situation at hand.<br><br>With the Great Exodus coming to an end, the Star Traders founded new colonies on the few remaining habitable worlds. The Templar Knights are called upon once again to defend the Star Traders and their new colonies from an ancient threat.<br><br>= WHO WE ARE = <br>Trese Brothers Games is a premier indie game developer of desktop and mobile RPG and strategy games.

"com.urajin.shatteredpixeldungeon"	"日本語版 Shattered Pixel Dungeon"	"500"	"4.1"	"<div jsname=""sngebd"">Shattered Pixel Dungeon（シャッタードピクセルダンジョン）の日本語版です。<br><br>Shattered Pixel DungeonはローグライクというタイプのRPGです。普通のRPGと違い、コツが分るまではスタートしてすぐにゲームオーバーになるでしょう。ゲームオーバーになると、せっかく手に入れた武器、防具、その他のアイテムはすべてなくなり、レベルもリセットされて、ダンジョンの一番最初から再スタートになります。再スタートすると毎回ダンジョンの形、部屋のパターン、アイテムの位置などはランダムに変化します。さまざまな工夫があるので、同じダンジョンを繰り返し探検しても飽きないはずです。コツが分れば先に進めるようになりますので、あきらめずに何度もチャレンジしてください。<br><br>もっとも基本的なゲームのルールを次に説明します。<br><br>[基本ルール]<br>●冒険者：4種類の個性あるキャラクターを選ぶことができます。（最初のうちは3種類しか選べません）<br><br>●ダンジョン：ゲームを新しく始めると、ダンジョンの形はランダムに決定されます。目的地はダンジョンの最下層にあるフロアなので下に向かってください。<br><br>●時間：冒険者が移動などの行動を行うと、それに合わせて時間が進みます。何もしなければ時間は進みません。<br><br>●ボス：最初のボスは地下5階にいます。そこまでに経験を積み、アイテムを見つけて十分に強くなってください。ボスを倒さなければ先に進めません。<br><br>●ゲームオーバー：冒険者がダメージを受けて死ぬと、アンクと呼ばれる復活アイテムを持っていなければそこでゲームオーバーです。また最初からチャレンジしてください。<br><br>●呪われたアイテム：アイテムは呪われていることがあります。呪われたアイテムは効果が発揮されないだけでなく、冒険者のダメージにもなることがあります。<br><br>●謎のアイテム：水薬や巻物は多数の種類がありますが、ダンジョンと同じように効果はランダムに入れ替わります。使うとダメージを受けるアイテムもあるので効果が確認できていないアイテムは慎重に使いましょう。<br><br>●セーブ：セーブは全自動です。アプリを再開した時にセーブされたところから続きができますが、ゲームオーバーになるとセーブは失われます。<br><br>●ゲームのモード：ノーマルモードとハードモードがあります。ハードモードは英語版のオリジナルと同じ難易度ですが、かなり難しいです。ノーマルモードは日本語版オリジナルで少し難易度を下げています。最初はノーマルモードをおすすめします。<br><br>基本的なルールを知っているだけでは生き残ることはできません。<br>最初は何回もゲームオーバーになると思いますが、いろいろと試してコツを覚えてください。<br><br>Shattered Pixel Dungeonは100％無料で最後まで遊べます。広告の視聴により補助的なアイテムがもらえますが、必要なければ広告はスキップできます。<br><br>ゲームの不具合や翻訳間違いなどあれば、次のホームページでコメントを頂けると助かります。<br><br>日本語版ホームページ<br>https://spdja.blogspot.com<br><br>上記ホームページはまだ始めたばかりなので内容が薄っぺらいですが、ゲームのコツなども少しずつ紹介していきますので、ときどきチェックしてください。<br><br>英語版オリジナルのホームページ<br>http://ShatteredPixel.com</div>"	"0.00"	"Role Playing"	"16"

We have added additional play modes as well as changes to make it play better on touchscreens. We are independent developers and the mobile game world resides on our servers. <br><br>If you have played the original game, you will recognize Jason's cute and quirky graphics and sounds, as well as the wonderful premise: rebuilding civilization from scratch, together with other players and across countless generations.<br><br>You are born either as a baby to one of the other players, or as a young woman if no suitable mother is found. Every minute of real time is one year in the game and your maximum age is 60 years. A single life is limited, but the things you make during your lifetime are left for your children and grandchildren once you are gone. Try to make life a little bit easier for those who come after you, so your family line will have a chance to prosper for generations to come.<br><br>Sometimes you will spawn alone in the wilderness. You need to build a fire to stay warm and trap rabbits to get meat and furs for clothes. A sharp stone may be your best friend in the beginning. Try to find a good spot to settle and grow some food, because other players may soon arrive as your children, and will need to be taken care of until they are grown enough to help you.<br><br>Sometimes you will be born in a sprawling city, with farmers, cooks, blacksmiths, shepherds and hunters. There will be clothes and equipment ready for you, prepared by players who may be your grandparents or distant relatives.

There is a small mailbox here. A rubber mat saying 'Welcome to<br>Zork!' lies by the door.<br><br>What next? &gt;_<br></i><br><br>With interactive fiction novels you're more than just a passive book reader, following the adventures of the hero. Instead, you become the hero! Explore the world, make decissions and ultimately decide on the outcome. IF stories are fun for hours, immersive as hell and play at your own pace, making them the ideal pass time for a long road trip and short work breaks alike.<br><br>TextFiction is definitely the best adaptation of the genre available for Android. You control the protagonist through a novel SMS like interface which replaces the need for typing commands with intuitive touch controls. Users of chat apps will instantly feel at home! The barrier-free design also makes this app the perfect choice for users with disabilities.<br><br>Hundreds of free RPG stories from dozens of literature genres (sci-fi, fantasy, mystery,... ) are available for download, ensuring entertainment for months to come. You can't get more offline games for free in one single app!<br><br><br><br><b><u>FEATURES:</u></b><br>* Supports z3, z5 and z8 z-machine games (may be wrapped in zblorb), no glulx<br>* Unique, instant messanger like user interface<br>* Configurable action keys to cut down on typing (long press to modify).  <br>* Tap words in the story to copy them into the commandline. Double tap to clear.<br>* Nightmode and classic Terp mode (""Lucy"", ""Mina"" and ""Jason"" colorscheme)  <br>* Optionally uses the Text To Spech engine to read stories out loud (long touch a bubble to start/stop narration).<br>* Touch sensitive borders/corners for moving in the designated cardinal direction (may be fiddly on small screens).<br>* Saving/restoring progress (including autosave when navigating away from the app)<br>* A real battery saver due to low power consumption and no ads (TextFiction is one of the few games that don't need wifi).<br><br><br><br><b><u>FAQ (please don't abuse the reviews as a support forum!):</u></b><br>Q: I'm new. What's an interactive story?<br>A: Have you ever read a novel and longed for taking part in the plot yourself? Interactive stories allow you to do exactly that. Textfiction is like a fanfiction reader (a library app for free books) that only describes to you the setting, but allows you to choose your own actions, often resolving in alternative endings.<br><br>Q: Are the games free?<br>A: Textfiction itself free to play. Most of the interactive novels are in the public domain and may be downloaded free of charge to your library.<br><br>Q: How do I save/restore a game?<br>A: Press the ""Plus"" button to bring up the menu. Save/restore commands won't work.<br><br>Q: Do I loose my progress when going back to the libary app?<br>A: No! Whenever you leave the story screen, the game performs an auto save. It does not, however, perform an autorestore when you return (leaving the game is suppose to be a reset).<br><br>Q: Why is the story output erased when I restore a game?<br>A: When you restore a game, you move to another part of the story. The current chat history no longer applies and gets discarded to avoid confusion.<br><br>Q: Can I change the action buttons?<br>A: Yes! just write something in the commandline, then long press a button to modify it.<br><br>Q: Can I write my own fanfiction stories?<br>A: Yes! The authoring tool of choice can be found here: http://inform7.com<br><br>Q: Why does my bluetooth keyboard repeat the enter key?<br>A: Text Fiction comes free of charge. Unfortunately, this means no budget for buying troublesome hardware in order to check the problem out.<br><br>Q: Will a 1* rating convince you to change the app according to my whims?<br>A: Go kiss a Grue</div>"	"0.00"	"Role Playing"	"2349"

"DeadlyDungeons.App"	"Deadly Dungeons"	"50000"	"4.3"	"<div jsname=""sngebd"">Deadly Dungeons is a first person RPG developed exclusively for the Android platform.  It is inspired by several classic dungeon crawlers and roguelikes.<br><br>After being separated from your adventuring party, you must navigate a deadly dungeon, and fight your way through hordes of creatures in a desperate attempt to escape alive.  What first begins as a simple escape to the surface turns into a fight for survival, a confrontation with an ancient evil, and a descent to hell itself. <br><br>Deadly Dungeons features several difficulty levels.  Casual, an easy mode that features a god-mode that allows you to play through the game quickly without fear of dying.  Normal, a standard gameplay mode with death and saving and loading.  Hardcore, a permadeath mode which deletes your save game upon death (not for the faint of heart).  Nightmare, an extremely difficult mode with permadeath and creatures that move twice as fast as normal. <br><br>Once you beat the game, it doesn't end there.  Start a new game and the dungeon scales to your current player level and features more difficult creatures with enhanced abilities.  There are 80+ creature levels of variation featuring over 80 different types of attacks creatures can perform.  Beware, the game starts off easy for casual players, but play beyond the initial starting level, and you will be met with challenges that are likely beyond your ability.<br><br>Other features include:<br><br>* Massive and deadly dungeon environments to adventurer through.<br>* Randomly generated dungeon levels, creatures, and items.<br>* Pages worth of dialog, journal entries, and environmental descriptions of the dungeon environment.<br>* First-person dungeon crawling<br>* Touch-based interface.<br><br>Visit http://deadlydungeons.com for more information.</div>"	"0.99"	"Role Playing"	"3228"

Nevertheless, within this prolonged season of peace, the Schwarzschild Empire has once again begun plotting world domination as it starts to conquer and occupy one nation after another. It is during this time that Ash and Karim, two residents of Heiland, a small town on the frontier, rescue a young woman and her escort as they are being pursued in the nearby woods by a contingent of foreign soldiers. Yet, who is this mysterious girl and what fate is in store for Ash and those with him as they attempt to help her fulfill her mission...? Find out as this dramatic story begins to unfold!<br><br><b>A classic Japanese role-playing game</b><br>Employing an orthodox turn-based battle system, Alphadia evokes a feeling of nostalgia with its classic gameplay style. In addition, its refined game balance and simple to use interface make this game easy for anyone to pick up and enjoy. Furthermore, with completely redrawn graphics, Alphadia's world shines on high-resolution touch screens.<br><br><b>Charming characters and a dramatic story</b><br>It is often thought that games on a cell phone can only offer a short, limited experience, but that is not the case with Alphadia. Alphadia boasts an expansive drama that spans 30+ hours of gameplay, and which is sure to pull on a few heartstrings as Ash and his party are faced with numerous challenges and trials.<br><br><b>Engage in strategic battles while exploiting the potential of energi</b><br>By mastering the various elementals, characters become adept in using a host of energi skills. Which energi skills characters learn beyond those of their inherent elemental, however, is given to the player to decide! Having such freedom lends itself to an overall richer gameplay experience in Alphadia.<br><br>As players learn to harness elementals in battle, they quickly become able to take advantage of their situation, and the thrill of battle increases. And of course, for those who prefer, there is an auto-function built into Alphadia's battle system that allows players to cut through waves of enemies with little effort should they choose.<br><br>*The actual price might differ depending on the region.<br><br>[Language]<br> -Japanese, English<br>[Supported OS]<br> - 1.6 and up<br>[Incompatible]<br>- Zenfone 2<br>* This app has generally been tested to work on any mobile device released in Japan.

It’s time to unleash your energi once again and enjoy an immersive experience in a new and exciting world honed to perfection with a massive graphical overhaul, richly developed characters, and a streamlined battle system!<br><br>Alphadia II takes players on an unforgettable adventure 200 years after the events of the first Alphadia. Though after seemingly being lost to the inhabitants of the world, energi once again makes its appearance, and before long begins to drive opposing powers into an all out scramble to take control of this ever diminishing resource.<br><br><br>Energi… the source of power interconnected with all living things.<br><br>In times of old, the human race erected a great civilization that thrived on the use of this power. However, some two centuries earlier, an incident known as the Energi Crisis erupted and led to the planet's energi being sealed away. As a result, people lost the mysterious powers they were once capable of harnessing.<br><br>The story now picks up with the protagonist, Leon, who has been assigned to his first solo mission by the Energi Guild. And there within his mind echo the words of the guildmistress when she stated: ""Energi is the hidden power within each individual. It is the power of the heart and mind, and when purposefully sought, its true potential is unleashed.""<br><br><b>Nostalgia at its best! It’s like old-school meets new-school with perfect harmony!</b><br>Sporting a colorful and gorgeously detailed 2D battle system, individual break skills, elementals that combine to create more powerful energi skills, and even an auto-battle function, Alphadia II comes equipped with everything fans of traditional JRPGs could expect and caters to both the hardcore and casual gamer alike!<br><br><b>Energi is the key!</b><br>Energi is derived from one of six unique elementals and has the power to not only grow, but lead players to the acquisition of new and more powerful energi skills. These energi skills then, in turn, play an integral role in attack, recovery, and even support. Furthermore, once two separate elementals have reached a certain level, they can be combined to create even more powerful energi skills!<br><br><b>Can you handle it?!</b><br>Aside from a voluminous story, Alphadia II offers a new ""Mission"" system in which players are able to accept missions from the guild in order to receive valuable coins. These coins can then be exchanged for powerful equipment and other hard-to-get items later on. In addition to the main story and missions is a wealth of subquests, making this title truly the whole package.

There are also disadvantageous effects. Also, effects apply to apply to both enemies and allies. However, by raising the level of the Chronos Gauge to 100% or more, you can launch Interrupt Actions.

The Gauge has a display like a clock, with the numbers 1 to 12, and at the start of a battle one of the numbers will glow. The glowing number will move clockwise each time an ally or enemy performs an action. At this time, if you use a skill corresponding to the glowing number, a Just Time Bonus will be triggered, and the level of the Gauge will recover by a large amount. Also, the level of the Gauge increases, although only by a little, when enemies are defeated.<br>The Gauge is shared across all party members, so it's a good idea to pay attention to the level as you use Particular Skills and launch Interrupt Actions!<br><br>*This game features some in-app-purchase content.

In one of those chambers, he discovers a golem built to oppose the Evils.<br>And so the quest begins: Ryle takes the fate of the kingdom on his shoulders, and, along with Denoas, the golem built to oppose the Evils, sets off first to the village of the elves...<br><br>This is KEMCO's first brand-new RPG designed from the ground up especially for smartphones!<br>Don't miss the epic story that unfolds around Ryle and Denoas and the characters they encounter, each with their own intentions and motives! <br><br><b>Smoothly Animated Dynamic Battles</b><br>Smooth animation and dramatic voice effects bring the characters' battle scenes to life.<br>There are huge numbers of enemies trying to stop your progress.

For example, an enemy might be clad in formidable armor to begin with, but if that armor is destroyed, the enemy's appearance changes and defense ability drops… but on the other hand, the enemy's movements might become swifter.<br>Don't ignore these changes- use them to alter the battle situation to your advantage!<br><br><b>Customize Weapons and Statuses!</b><br>The characters' weapons are each made up of parts, and by combining these parts, you can change attack strength, not to mention the magic and skills the characters can use.<br>What's more, by reinforcing weapons at a Weapon Shop, you can upgrade the weapons to be much more powerful than they originally were.<br>In addition, by assigning Merit Points on the Status screen, you can strengthen different statuses as you want- and you can adjust these statuses at any time.<br><br>*The actual price might differ depending on the region.<br><br>[Supported OS versions]<br>- 2.1 and up<br>[Installation on SD card]<br>- Enabled<br>[Supported languages]<br>- Japanese, English<br><br>[IMPORTANT NOTICE]<br>Your use of the application requires your agreement to the following EULA and 'Privacy Policy and Notice'.

It is an isometric game, inspired by some of the best role-playing games from the past decades; it brings back the old spirit of the classics in many ways: a challenging environment, choices with consequences, and a solid game system, with different paths to develop your character.<br><br><u>Explore</u> the world: no one will point you to the best hidden secrets. Talk to hundreds of different characters, each with <u>unique dialogues</u>, and solve dozens of quests. Customize your character with dozens of skills and hundreds of different items. Overcome all kind of monsters and antagonists, choosing carefully the weapons or powers for each encounter. And return to the classical dungeon crawl, with traps and secret doors, and death awaiting the unwary adventurer behind every corner.<br><br>Forums and more information: http://www.exiledkingdoms.com<br><br><b>Free version: </b> allows to play as a Warrior or a Rogue. It includes 30 areas, 29 completable quests (others partially completable), around 30 hours of gameplay, with a level cap adequate to the areas available. <br><br><b>Full version: </b> a single in-app purchase which unlocks everything, forever (no micro-transactions).

Additionally, the full version unlocks the Iron-Man mode (permadeath) and makes the Cleric and Mage classes available.<br><br>There are NO further micro-transactions. No pay-to-win, no ""energy"", no ads. Just a game, like they used to be.<br><br><br><u><font color=""blue""><b>Story introduction: A dark tale, and a brave new world</b></font></u><br><br>A century ago, the Andorian Empire was destroyed by a magical cataclysm that brought The Horrors into our world; humanity was nearly annihilated. Many thousands managed to escape sailing away to the Imperial Colony of Varannar: a savage island, dangerous and unexplored. Mistrust and blame made impossible to elect a new Emperor, and the four Exiled Kingdoms were proclaimed.<br><br>Nowadays, the ragtag kingdoms still struggle to survive in a harsh land, often waging war on each other. Empire and the Horrors are, for many, just old legends and fairytales. You are a novice adventurer, rarely paying attention to such old stories; you're more concerned with your latest misadventures and lack of gold.<br><br>But for once, luck seems to be on your side. You received a letter from New Garand, stating that you are the sole beneficiary of a big inheritance. You don’t remember any relatives in the capital of the Kingdom of Varsilia, but certainly that won’t stop you from an opportunity like this! The road to New Garand will reveal many surprises, and will teach you that fairytales and legends can become, in fact, very real.<br><br><b>Permissions information:</b> the game asks for internet access for connection to Google Play Games. The permission to access your storage is needed to be able to export your saved games to a file or to the cloud.
