The timing and frequencies are completely <strong>randomized</strong>, so that an animal cannot get 'used to' the sound - which is the main problem with other apps.<br><br>Make sure you turn your phone's <strong>media volume</strong> to maximum - or even better, connect your phone to external speakers for more power. To make sure the app does not sleep because of Android's battery-saver, just leave the screen on and keep your phone charging to scare away most varieties of rodent and potentially other pests too. Unlike other similar apps, this app has a built-in screensaver and NO ads :)<br><br>Most of the frequencies are too high for humans to be able to hear, so it should not disturb your sleep. But you can adjust the minimum and maximum frequencies, if necessary. We suggest running this app near where you keep food - you could run the app near where mice try to get into your property, but they may just find another way in. <br><br>We recommend you use an old spare phone to run this app, so that you can leave it running somewhere 24/7.

"biz.infosoft.tiltmeter"	"TILTMETER"	"1000"	"4.3"	"<div jsname=""sngebd"">OVERVIEW<br><br>The core idea is simple: to measure the position of cellphone or tablet relative to the vector of the Earth  gravitational forces using integrated acceleration sensor (see the MotoG screenshot with sensors reading related to the gravitational acceleration). The right angle relative to the vector of gravitational force indicates the perfectly aligned flat surface. <br><br>USAGE<br><br>The use-cases are similar to anything which could be done with well-known tilt-meters (a.k.a. ""bubble level""), for example aligning the pictures on the wall. Place the cellphone (front-facing in either portrait or landscape orientation) on the top of the object (e.g. wall picture) to check its horizontal alignment. On-screen linear analog gauge accompanied by digital meter provides accurate inclination measurement in the range between -5 and 5 degrees which is enough for most practical cases. The airplane image below the scale adds certain entertaining factor and provides the intuitive visual feedback to the alignment procedure.<br><br>User can adjust the meter's responsiveness (in other words, the virtual inertia) selecting either normal, fast or slow motion. Be aware that cellphone/tablet sensors' sampling rate may vary, an so is the app responsiveness.<br><br>Pressing the on-screen control button with small airplane icon will temporarily  ""freeze"" the screen reading and change the icon (see the screenshot showing the pop-up message ""Stopped...""). Press it twice to release the screen and return to normal operations (screenshot w/message ""Running..."" and the original button icon restored).<br><br>CALIBRATION<br><br>Out-of-the-box uncalibrated high-end cellphones provides typical accuracy of tilt measurement within  ±1 angular degree, which is sufficient for many practical use-cases. Certain improvement could be achieved via device offset calibration (option available in version 1.4 and higher): first, place the phone (or tablet) on a flat surface in a portrait mode and select Calibrate-&gt; CalibrateX menu item. Then repeat the same procedure for landscape (horizontal) device orientation and select Calibrate-&gt;CalibrateY menu option. To rollback calibration press RESET button to restore the original settings (they will be automatically restored on device power off).<br><br>KEEP AWAKE<br><br>If checked will keep the phone power-on while app is running.<br><br>NOTES<br><br>This app requires the integrated Accelerometer sensor to be available in a smartphone.</div>"	"0.00"	"House & Home"	"6"

This makes it the largest energy expense in most homes. IM Home and a smart thermostat can reduce your energy bills about $150 annually.  <br><br>IM Home saves energy by working with a Wi-Fi smart thermostat to understand how your home uses energy, your local weather and your comfort levels. IM Home continually checks for ways to reduce your energy use.<br><br>When it finds the best time to save energy, IM Home will automatically adjust the temperature while still keeping you comfortable. But you always have control and can adjust the temperature in your home at any time.<br><br>IM Home makes a smart thermostat smarter. You can save about 10% on your energy bill, get $330 in rebates and bill credits, plus reduce your carbon footprint. To register for IM home go to ElectricIdeas.com/IMHome or call 855-607-3788.<br><br>How IM Home Saves Energy<br>* IM Home connects to your Wi-Fi smart thermostat to learn what temperatures keep you comfortable. It works in the background to understand how your home uses energy based on your local weather, how long your air conditioner usually runs and how quickly or slowly the temperature changes in your home.<br>* IM Home checks for ways to save energy every day. When it sees a way to save more, it tweaks your regular schedule by a few degrees. You probably won’t even notice.<br>* If the forecast for the next day calls for a hot and/or humid day, IM Home notifies you an “event” will happen the next day.<br>* The morning of the event, IM Home “pre-cools” your home by a few degrees and monitors temperature of your home during the event. If the temperature in your home goes up too much, your air conditioner will run.<br><br>For example, your temperature is normally set at 74°. Your home is pre-cooled in the morning by a few degrees. During the event the temperature of your home rises to above    your set comfort zone – your air conditioner runs. If you home’s temperature doesn’t go above your set comfort zone, the air conditioner stays off and you save even more.<br>* You can opt out of the event by setting your thermostat to the desired temperature. However, you will not get the bill credit or energy savings.<br>* An event will not last longer than 6 hours and will only occur Monday – Friday. There are a maximum of 15 events between May and September.<br>* Each time you participate in a peak reduction event, you get a $1.95 bill credit, up to $29.25 per year. <br><br>Ecobee or Honeywell Thermostat Owners<br>If you already own an Ecobee or Honeywell TCC smart thermostat you can get a $25 rebate plus year-round energy savings. Simply download IM Home and register for IM Home<br><br>Eligibility<br>To be eligible for IM Home rebates, you must meet the following criteria.<br>1. Be an I&amp;M residential customer.<br>2. Enrolled in IM Home for at least one year.<br>3. Have Wi-Fi which works at least 90% of time.<br>4. Have an Apple or Android smart phone.<br>5.

They are typically small, usually have a capacity of 2-4 persons, and only serve 2-5 floors. They may have unique design characteristics suited for home furnishings. There are two types of landing doors used in residential elevators; manual hinged wooden shaft-access doors and metal sliding doors, usually two-speed center opening type. Construction may be less robust than in commercial designs with shorter maintenance periods, but safety systems such as locks on shaft access doors, fall arrestors, and emergency phones must still be present in the event of malfunction. <br>Elevator fixtures in residential elevators are relatively simple. The call button panel only has one call button, and sometimes have floor position indicator. The car operating panel only contains the floor buttons, the door controls, the alarm button, and a small floor position indicator. Some elevators do not have door close button. <br>Residential elevators use modern hydraulics to produce a smooth, quiet ride while occupying a minimum amount of space. These hydraulic systems are quiet, producing about the same amount of sound as a typical refrigerator, which makes them well suited for residential use. They can be operated at any hour without causing disturbance. Hydraulic residential elevators are very rare.<br>INSTALL this Home Elevators App and learn all you need about Home Elevators, there types and how to choose a Home Elevators.</div>"	"0.00"	"House & Home"	"23"

Algunos libros tocan el tema y usan la Biblia pero evitan profundizar y mostrar las responsabilidades del hombre como representante de Cristo, y las responsabilidades de la mujer como representante de la Iglesia. Deseo hacer esto y abrirles los ojos a lo que es el matrimonio espiritualmente como fue establecido.<br>Mi deseo es que este libro ayude a los matrimonios en su relación matrimonial, cuando se den cuenta de lo que representa y como deberían tratarse mutuamente.<br>En segundo lugar, este libro fue hecho por la inmensa ignorancia y concepción errónea de la mayoría de los creyentes (también los del mundo) sobre el matrimonio y como ese matrimonio debería funcionar de acuerdo a Dios. Demasiadas personas se han olvidado que el matrimonio fue establecido por Dios mismo, y fue establecido no tan solo para que la humanidad se ""fructificara y multiplicara y llenara la tierra"" (Génesis 1:28), sino que también para mantener moralmente a la sociedad y para que hogares se quedaran juntos por el bien de los niños. Además, fue establecido para que cada cónyuge amara y confortara al otro, y al hacer eso suplir las necesidades de su compañero y de uno mismo.<br><br>Finalmente, esta aplicación fue diseñada porque el autor ha visto muchos divorcios entre Creyentes. Demasiadas personas, hoy en día, no ven el matrimonio como si fuera para toda la vida. Creen que si no funciona podrán comenzar nuevamente con otra persona. ¡Estas cosas no deberían ser así!<br>El matrimonio debe ser algo enseñado por los padres a sus hijos como algo que es bueno, sano, y moralmente correcto. Y siempre debería ser como el voto dice, ""Hasta que la muerte los separe.""<br>Espero en estas próximas páginas presentar lo que es el matrimonio, y como cada cónyuge debe hacer su parte, sin importar lo difícil que pueda ser, para que su matrimonio funcione. Y espero que los textos presentados enseñen a los que verdaderamente están buscando como honrar a Dios quien estableció el matrimonio.<br>Así que comencemos nuestro paseo a través de la Biblia y estudiemos la institución maravillosa de Dios, llamada Matrimonio. lo pueden descargar y compartir con los que deseen, Que lo disfruten.</div>"	"0.00"	"House & Home"	"6"
"com.andromo.dev708981.app862352"	"Marriage and Divorce"	"500"	"5"	"<div jsname=""sngebd"">This application was written with the purpose of trying to show the reader what God says and thinks about marriage and divorce. The first reason, and the most important, is that there are too many books on the subject that do not go deep enough about the spiritual aspect of marriage, and its wonderful representation of Christ and the Church. Some books touch on the subject and use the Bible but avoid deepening and showing the responsibilities of man as the representative of Christ, and the responsibilities of women as representatives of the Church. I want to do this and open my eyes to what marriage is spiritually as it was established.<br>My wish is that this book will help marriages in their marriage relationship, when they realize what it represents and how they should treat each other.<br>Secondly, this book was made by the immense ignorance and misconception of most believers (also those of the world) about marriage and how that marriage should work according to God. Too many people have forgotten that marriage was established by God Himself, and was established not only for humanity to ""fructify and multiply and fill the earth"" (Genesis 1:28), but also to morally maintain society and for homes to stay together for the sake of the children. In addition, it was established so that each spouse would love and comfort the other, and in doing so, meet the needs of their partner and oneself.<br><br>Finally, this application was designed because the author has seen many divorces between Believers. Too many people, nowadays, do not see marriage as if it were for life. They believe that if it does not work they can start again with another person. These things should not be like this!<br>Marriage should be something taught by parents to their children as something that is good, healthy, and morally correct. And it should always be like the vote says, ""Till death do you part.""<br>I hope in these next pages to present what marriage is, and how each spouse must do his part, no matter how difficult it may be, for his marriage to work. And I hope that the texts presented will teach those who are truly seeking to honor God who established marriage.<br>So let's begin our walk through the Bible and study the wonderful institution of God, called Marriage. can download and share with those who wish, enjoy it.</div>"	"0.00"	"House & Home"	"5"

To get inspired to create our own batch of cool wooden objects, we turned to our favorite fellow makers to see what creative projects they’ve come up with. Here are our top 45 DIY wood project picks. <br> <br>Brit + Co Wood Burned Cutting Board Kit: A customizable cutting board is the perf housewarming gift for your newly relocated friends. DIY for your buds or let them do the honor — but either way don’t forget the cheese! <br> <br>DIY Wooden Picture Holders: Personalize your desk space and display your best Insta shots with a DIY picture holder that calls for nothing more that a little wood, spray paint, and some inspiration. Add color as needed. <br> <br>DIY Anthropologie Wall Organizer Hack: We love Anthro *almost* as much as we love a good hack and this sweet wall DIY falls nothing short of fabulously organized. <br> <br>DIY Painted Birch Slice Coasters: Just in time for summer dinners with all the rose, these pastel birch coasters make a cute (and useful) addition to rest your bev on. <br> <br>DIY Color Block Wood Planter: Dress your cacti up in color blocked planters that are easy to make! These bright boxes make sweet gifts too. <br> <br>Wooden Bungee Organizers: First, something from the Brit + Co. archive. These organizers were made using hobby board and bungee. They’re great for organizing sunglasses, cords, and scarves, especially in small apartments and homes. <br> <br>Painted Wooden Spoons: You’ve likely seen this one kicking around Pinterest, but it’s so bright and colorful we just had to include it. <br> <br>Antler Jewelry Board: If you go for a wander in just about any area that has tons of deer, you will definitely find a good amount of antlers that have been shed. Turn them into a caddy for all of your necklaces. <br> <br>Tree Branch Table: Cut one too many logs this winter? Turn them into a beautiful table by following this manly DIY. <br> <br>Wooden Ring Pendants: We love the look of these wrapped wooden rings.

It is a drawing of the scenic element (or the entire set) as seen from the front and has all the measurements written on it. <br> <br>Exterior - Front of home <br>Use potted plants as dots. Hedges that fan out create a foreground; pencillike trees frame the entrance sequence. A crushed stone path, our center line, leads to the front door as reinforcement of the symmetrical massing and window pattern. <br> <br>Front Elevation <br>You’d like to reduce watering or other maintenance costs. A front yard renovation can be a prime opportunity to consider which site elements can be made more ecologically sustainable. New plantings and lawn alternatives can help your new front yard conserve water. Strategically placed trees can help reduce cooling costs in summer by shading your home, and heating costs in winter by blocking wind. <br> <br>Amherst Exterior <br>The look as grown on me though and I can appreciate both styles. All of the windows and doors on this front elevation are wrapped in cast stone. We will generally use cast stone on all front elevations or on any high profile areas.

It’s the first thing that you see driving up to your house, and you can wow guests before they even enter your home. Just remember that curb appeal is important, but no matter how pretty your landscape is, it needs to be functional.<br><br>- Hardscape First<br>Do all of your hardscaping projects before you set out any plants. Hardscaping can include a porch, sidewalk, driveway, parking areas, decks, fencing, patios and arbor. These projects usually involve construction, which can compact your soil or damage turf and plantings, so it’s important to complete any heavy work before plantings begin.<br><br>- Toil In the Soil<br>When it is time to garden, amend your soil by adding organic matter such as finely shredded pine bark, peat moss, mushroom compost or leaf mold before setting out plants. Loose, fertile soil will encourage root growth on new plantings and allow them to become established quickly. Clearly define your turf and bed lines. First use a garden hose to lay out your bed lines then use orange spray paint to mark the lines.<br><br>- Plant Next to Your House<br>Your foundation planting should embrace your house and not cover it. Low-growing shrubs or groundcover should be planted in front of low windows and porches. Larger rounded shrubs or small trees work well planted on the corners of your home. These larger plants will frame up your house and help soften the box-like structure. Remember to create a small bed in your front yard for annual color.

Start by choosing the color scheme that you like. After that you can adjust other elements: starting from the floor, table, wall color, accessories and lighting. One of the tips that we can provide is to design the bathroom together with the kitchen because there are several items needed in both rooms: sink, tiled floor, table. For bathrooms, of course you need a shower, bath tub, etc.<br><br>How to arrange and arrange bathroom furniture?<br>Especially if you have a small or limited dimension bathroom, the task of arranging it is not easy, especially because the neatness and cleanliness standards should be fulfilled for the health of the occupants of the house. Clean furniture regularly: Bathroom furniture prone to weathering and damage due to high humidity, prone to exposure to soap, foam and other chemicals. Use a clean cloth and special cleaning fluid while keeping the furniture tidy. Get rid of useless items: If it is not used, get rid of it immediately and do not place it in another place because it will accumulate so that the bathroom will not be neat and gradually become dirty. Storing objects that eat places like hair dryers, towels and other objects in the drawer will also make the bathroom feel wider. Check the available storage space / space: Has the storage space been used effectively or have many unused items piled up? Drugs and expired creams, for example, should be discarded immediately. Return the items used in their place: The items that are often used are most often scattered because sometimes they are not returned in their original place. Stay simple: Keep the choice of decorative elements simple. Combining matching objects such as soap, toothbrush etc. helps to keep the decoration simple and harmonious.<br><br>How do you choose the floor and wall of the bathroom?<br>Walls and floors should not only be beautiful but also functional. Bathroom floors and walls must be resistant to moisture, heat and stains. Tiles (especially ceramics) are good choices for both, besides that they also give the impression of luxury. For the impression of rustic or more modern, wood that is given a waterproof coating can also be a beautiful choice. Another more economical option is bamboo, because it is leakproof, hot and humid but more affordable in the bag. Many choices of waterproof wallpaper, all you need is to make sure your designer and contractor explain all the options in a comprehensive manner.<br><br>How do you choose bathroom accessories?<br>When designing a bathroom, it is often a second function. But what most people don't know yet, is that choosing the right accessories can determine the comfort of your routine, so it's important to choose the right accessories from the start. Modern design will be more suitable with modern lighting and geometric accessories, industrial design will be better suited to dark colors that expose pipes and channels as decorations. How cohesive the overall design is is the target you want to achieve, therefore adhering to the style and color you have chosen should be your priority.<br>Let's design the bathroom according to our wishes.

En el caso de los árboles, no olvides clavar y sujetar el ejemplar a un tutor firme para que se mantenga vertical. Para saber regar las plantas es necesaria mucha observación y aprender de los errores. Riega por la mañana temprano o al atardecer, no con el sol en todo lo alto. <br><br>Todos los años debes aportar a todas tus plantas algún tipo de abono. Te recomiendo, por último, que añadas a la tierra, o que pulverices sobre las hojas, quelatos de hierro y otros micronutrientes con el fin de prever la carencia de Hierro y así tener hojas más verdes. El césped abónalo con 3 aplicaciones/año. <br><br>Sobre la malla extiende cortezas de pino, chinos o gravas de colores para conseguir un acabado estético. Si las arrancas a mano o con azada, teniendo constancia, se irán debilitando y cada vez saldrán menos sin necesidad de recurrir a los herbicidas tipo Glifosato. Riega el día antes de deshierbar para que el terreno esté húmedo y así extraer las malezas con más facilidad.<br><br><br>Las Plantas Vivaces y de Temporada si están larguiruchas y poco densas se deben recortar ligeramente las puntas de los brotes para provocar que se desarrollen tallos laterales y hacer una mata más compacta y ramificada. Inspecciona con frecuencia las hojas para descubrir la presencia de parásitos o cualquier signo de enfermedad.<br><br>Si el año anterior ha habido fuertes ataques de alguna plaga u hongo, es lógico que vuelva a repetirse, por tanto, debes tratar preventivamente con insecticidas o fungicidas. Trata preventivamente los rosales una vez al mes con fungicida para evitar hongos como Oidio, Mildiu, Mancha negra y Roya. <br><br>Si te gustaron estos consejos, no dudes en descagar la aplicación para que veas todo lo que puedes hacer.</div>"	"0.00"	"House & Home"	"8"

It’s important to take measurements of the room so that you can guarantee the furniture you choose will fit perfectly. Furniture which is even just a little bit too big can look clunky and awkward, whereas furniture which is too small for the room will make it appear sparse. You should also consider which colours to use: larger rooms can carry bold or darker colours, whereas small dining rooms will benefit from a neutral colour scheme. In addition to the colours, lighting should also be a key consideration. Utilise natural light by placing the dining room table beneath or near a window, and opt for spotlights or wall lights which will disperse light throughout the room, rather than focusing it all on one area. <br>This app contains the various of Amazing Dining Room Design such as: dining room decoration, dinig roo mchairs, dining room table, dinig room set, small dining room, cheap dining room<br><br>No 1 App For Amazing Dining Room Design with step by step in <b>Play Store</b><br><br>Feature List:<br>✓ Amazing 400+ Amazing Dining Room Design.<br>✓ 400+ Amazing Dining Room Design in best quality.<br>✓ Lots of perfect 400+ Amazing Dining Room Design in HD Quality.<br>✓ You can share all images to social media and other<br>✓ You can add Amazing Dining Room Design into favorite list<br>✓ Zoom in, zoom out for all images. <br>✓ Application works offline.

It's where we stuff our faces and snore loudly in privacy, where we connect to our loved ones or center ourselves. It's only natural that it be the first thing to which we turn our attentions. We've already looked at ways to reduce waste and ways to conserve resources in the home.<br><br>However, much of what we do to live green isn't something that fits on a list of ideas. In our every choice, we attempt to decrease our footprint by turning off the faucet a few seconds faster or choosing not to use a light whenever possible. We may buy the smaller laptop to save resources, make sacrifices that aren't necessary to our lives, or find ways to enjoy and entertain ourselves in new, sustainable, and hopefully more meaningful ways.<br><br>All of these daily choices may seem overwhelming if you're trying to implement all right now, but with time and patience they work together to simplify our lives...and yeah, create that life that we actually want to sustain.<br><br>To save the planet, start with your house; this Application video series gives you tips on how to keep a green home.<br><br>         ✰✰✰ Support Us By Rating Us 5 ★★★★★ ✰✰✰  <br> ✰✰✰ Please contact us first if you have any question! ✰✰✰<br> ""</div>"	"0.00"	"House & Home"	"0"

"com.HouseVentilationFansbelbo"	"House Ventilation Fans"	"10000"	"3.7"	"<div jsname=""sngebd"">Whole house cooling using a whole house fan can substitute for an air conditioner most of the year in most climates. Whole house fans combined with ceiling fans and other circulating fans provide acceptable summer comfort for many families, even in hot weather. In addition to whole house fans, the ducts of your central heating and cooling system can be modified to provide whole house cooling.<br>HOW WHOLE HOUSE FANS WORK<br>The whole house fan pulls air in from open windows and exhausts it through the attic and roof. It provides good attic ventilation in addition to whole house cooling. Whole house fans should provide houses with 30 to 60 air changes per hour (varies with climate, floor plan, etc.—check with a professional to determine what is appropriate for your home). The air-change rate you will choose depends on your climate and how much you will depend on the whole house fan for cooling.<br>INSTALLING AND USING A WHOLE HOUSE FAN<br>Installing a whole house fan is tricky and should be done by a professional. An experienced professional should take your attic measurements and install your dedicated circuit wiring and, if needed, your new attic vents.<br>Attic ventilation will usually need to be increased to exhaust the fan's air outdoors. You'll need 2 to 4 times the normal area of attic vents, or about one square foot of net free area for every 750 cubic feet per minute of fan capacity. The net free area of a vent takes into account the resistance offered by its louvers and insect screens. More vent area is better for optimal whole house fan performance.<br>If your fan doesn't come with a tight-sealing winter cover, you should either buy one or build one. If you switch between air conditioning and cooling with a whole house fan as the summer weather changes, build a tightly sealed, hinged door for the fan opening that is easy to open and close when switching cooling methods.<br>Be cautious when operating these large exhaust fans. Open windows throughout the house to prevent a powerful and concentrated suction in one location. If enough ventilation isn't provided, the fans can cause a backdraft in your furnace, water heater or gas-fired dryer, pulling combustion products such as carbon monoxide into your living space.<br>DRAWBACKS OF WHOLE HOUSE FANS<br>Whole house fans can be noisy, especially if improperly installed. In general, a large-capacity fan running at low speed makes less noise than a small fan operating at high speed. All whole house fans should be installed with rubber or felt gaskets to dampen noise. You can set a multi-speed fan to a lower speed when noise is a problem.<br>USING YOUR DUCT SYSTEM AS A WHOLE HOUSE FAN<br>You may be able to use the heating and air conditioning ducts in your home as a means of whole house ventilation. This would involve installing an intake duct to pull air into an attic-mounted system that directs the air into your heating and cooling ducts. A damper would control exhaust air from your home into the attic. Check with a local professional to find out if this option is right for you</div>"	"0.00"	"House & Home"	"46"

Choose a single color or color theme to bring minimalist harmony to your home. ""If you have a monochromatic space and are using one dominant color on all key pieces of furniture, it's important to alter textures within the color for contrast and interest,"". ""If you have more than one color, stick to your color story and don't vary from it. Repeat it throughout the space to tie everything together for a cohesive, consistent palette.""<br><br>""Balance is very important to pay attention to in minimalist design,"" explains Moreau. ""Arrange pillows, artwork or lamps in flanking pairs or asymmetrically to one side."" This will make a big difference in how you perceive the space if the placement of items builds off each group through balance or juxtaposition.

Unfinished wood provides a natural and rustic look and tends to blend in naturally with trees, shrubs and grass. Many people choose wood fencing as it is not only visually pleasing but has a distinct old-fashioned feel to it. It also has the advantage of being bio-degradable - a wooden fence, once you have decided that it's reached the end of its useful life, can be torn down and recycled or even used as mulch for the garden.<br><br>There are several different styles of fencing and the type of home you have may influence the style of fencing. A picket style fence seems to go with a cottage style home or a garden based on an English landscape design, whereas a split-rail fence and similar designs seem to go with ranch style houses or a Southwest theme. If your home is in a setting with lots of trees, a wood fence is an obvious choice; flowers and bushes tend to look their best against a wooden fence.<br><br>Just as there are different styles of fencing, there are also several different types of wood that are used, although around 80 percent of all wooden fences are made from Western red cedar or pine that has been pressure treated. Pine fencing is generally easy to find, is long lasting and inexpensive; red cedar is also known for its durability and is also naturally resistant to rotting and warping.<br><br>It's important that a fence is installed correctly; this will ensure that it lasts as long as possible and needs as little maintenance as possible. The posts should always be planted in at least 18 inches of concrete, to ensure stability. A properly installed wooden fence generally provides more security and privacy than other types of fence; it's difficult to knock down or cut a hole through.<br><br>As with other types of fencing, wood fencing can easily be personalized and you can add a variety of extra features or furnishings to it. Wood is easy to shape or cut into the style that that is just what you are looking for and a wooden fence can be left unfinished or easily painted. An attractive and increasingly popular alternative to wooden fencing is bamboo fencing, which looks more natural and will last just as long.<br><br><br><br>contac us ; suportivoncap@gmail.com</div>"	"0.00"	"House & Home"	"0"

"com.kasmeestudio.desainapartemen"	"Desain Apartemen"	"100"	"1"	"<div jsname=""sngebd"">Tentang Apartemen<br>---------------------------------<br>Apartemen / Flat merupakan sebuah model tempat tinggal yang hanya mengambil sebagian kecil dari suatu ruang bangunan, seringkali disebut “rumah-rumah”. Didalam apartemen itu ada beberapa rumah yang ditinggali oleh keluarga yang berbeda. Saat ini tinggal di apartemen menjadi gaya hidup dan kebutuhan masyarakat modern masa kini karena lokasi apartemen yang strategis membuat banyak kalangan yang menggemari model hunian ini. Biasanya dibangun dekat dengan kawasan perkantoran, bisnis, industri, sekolah, pusat perbelanjaan, pusat hiburan serta dekat dengan akses tol, seperti apartemen puri park view yang lokasinya strategis dekat dengan kawasan sentra bisnis puri indah dan dekat akses jalan tol Kebon Jeruk, Jakarta Barat. Dengan berbagai fasilitas di sekelilingnya.<br><br>Lalu bagaimana cara memilih apartemen dengan harga terjangkau namun tetap berkelas? Berikut beberapa hal dan aspek serta faktor pertimbangan dalam memilih apartemen:<br><br>1. Lokasi merupakan aspek pertama yang perlu diperhatikan dalam membeli apartemen. Hal pertama yang mesti anda lakukan adalah perhatikan jarak tempuh yang paling dekat dengan tempat anda beraktivitas sehari-hari (kantor / tempat berbisnis anda), sehingga lebih efisien menghemat waktu tempuh, biaya transportasi serta tenaga.<br><br>2. Kedua adalah Fasilitas, karena fasilitas pada apartemen merupakan keunggulan dibandingkan dengan model hunian lainnya. Pastikan tersedia berbagai fasilitas, seperti pusat kesehatan dan kebugaran (kolam renang, fitness center, jogging track dll), pusat perbelanjaan/mini market, restoran, tempat parkir yang luas, taman bermain anak-anak, atm dan banking, keamanan (Security, CCTV &amp; Access card) dan lain sebagainya di apartemen yang anda pilih.<br><br>3. Biaya Perawatan (Maintenance), Faktor ini cukup penting untuk di perhatikan, karena biaya perawatan sifatnya berkala. Bila tinggal dirumah banyak sekali macam iuran yang harus dibayar mulai dari keamanan, kebersihan, listrik, telepon, tukang potong rumput, iuran acara RT dsb. Beda dengan apartemen yang cukup sekali saja perbulan, karena sudah akumulasikan. bahkan ada pengelola apartement yang menagih per 6 bulan biaya maintenancenya. Tapi memang nominal keselurahannya untuk biaya perawatan apartemen lebih mahal di bandingkan rumah.<br><br>4.Keempat adalah Legalitas Jika kita membeli sebuah rumah, maka kita akan mendapat SHM (Surat Hak Milik). SHM adalah surat kepemilikan yang terkuat, tidak ada batas waktu, bisa diwariskan turun temurun. Jika kita membeli sebuah apartemen maka kita akan mendapat sertifikat HGB (Hak Guna Bangunan). HGB ada batasan waktunya sampai 20 tahun. Dan perhatikan juga apakah sertifikat tersebut HGB murni / HGB diatas HPL (Hak Pengelolaan Lahan). Kalau HGB murni berarti tanah tersebut milik developer, jika setelah sertifikat HGB habis maka bisa diperpanjang. Kalau HGB di atas HPL berarti tanah tersebut bukan milik Developer melainkan kerjasama developer dengan pihak lain sebagai pemilik tanah. Setelah jangka waktu kerjasama habis maka hak bangunan dan tanah menjadi hak pemilik tanah.<br><br>Tentang Aplikasi<br>-------------------------<br>Desain Apartemen merupakan aplikasi yang berisi Kumpulan gambar desain Apartemen terbaru dan terlengkap.

Mebel berasal dari kata movable, yang artinya bisa bergerak. Pada zaman dahulu meja kursi dan lemari relatif mudah digerakkan dari batu besar, tembok, dan atap. Sedangkan kata furniture berasal dari bahasa Prancis fourniture (1520-30 Masehi). Fourniture mempunyai asal kata fournir yang artinya furnish atau perabot rumah atau ruangan. Walaupun mebel dan furniture punya arti yang beda, tetapi yang ditunjuk sama yaitu meja, kursi, lemari, dan seterusnya.<br><br>Dalam kata lain, mebel atau furnitur adalah semua benda yang ada di rumah dan digunakan oleh penghuninya untuk duduk, berbaring, ataupun menyimpan benda kecil seperti pakaian atau cangkir. Mebel terbuat dari kayu, papan, kulit, sekrup, dll.<br><br>Mebel akan terasa fungsinya jika tidak ada di rumah. Kita akan terpaksa duduk berselonjor, tidur di lantai dan kedinginan, membuka laptop di lantai. Pakaian tergeletak di lantai. Kaki cepat kesemutan, tidur dan bekerja juga tidak nyaman, barang-barang berantakan. Terasa manfaat mebel atau furniture: membuat rumah kita nyaman untuk beristirahat, bekerja, serta membantu rumah kita menjadi lebih rapi.<br><br>Itu sebabnya furniture atau mebel berumur sangat tua dan masih bertahan hingga sekarang. Mebel tertua yang ditemukan sampai saat ini adalah mebel pada situs di Oarkney, peninggalan zaman neolithic sekitar tahun 3100–2500 SM (Sebelum Masehi).<br><br>Tentang Aplikasi<br>-------------------------<br>Desain Furniture merupakan aplikasi yang berisi Kumpulan gambar desain Furniture terbaru dan terlengkap.

"com.kasmeestudio.desainhometheater"	"Desain Home Theater"	"100"	"0"	"<div jsname=""sngebd"">Tentang Home Theater<br>---------------------------------<br>Saat ini, bagi anda yang hobi menonton film dengan suasana bioskop tidak hanya dapat disaksikan di bioskop, akan tetapi anda dapat menyaksikannya di rumah. Pastinya anda akan bertanya ko bisa? Menonto film dengan suasana seperti menonton film di bioskop ternyata dapat dilakukan di rumah, caranya dengan menggunakan perlengkapan rumah tangga yang disebut Home Theater.<br><br>Sebuah home theater diartikan sebagai sebuah theater atau bioskop yang ada di dalam rumah. Untuk konsepnya sendiri home theater ini meniru sistem kerja sebuah theater atau bioskop dalam hal perlengkapan menonton. Istilah home theater sering diartikan dengan istilah bioskop rumah, tentunya dengan ini anda mendapatkan sensasi menonton seperti di bioskop.<br><br>Maka dapat disimpulkan home theater atau bioskop rumah adalah seperangkat alat elektronik hiburan yang diseting untuk menyajikan suasana menonton seperti di bioskop. Biasanya home theater terdiri dari perangkat video dan audio yang terdiri dari fitur audio 5 in 1 ch, 7 in 1 ch dan 9 in 1 ch (5 in ch biasanya dikenal dengan 5.1ch, begitu juga dengan fitur audio lainnya) dan untuk perangkat ini dilengkapi dengan banyak jumlah speaker. Untuk home theater standar biasanya menggunakan 4 speaker audio R dan L, 1 unit speaker center dan 1 sobwofer, ke 4 speaker audio R dan L ini tentunya memiliki audio yang berbeda-beda, untuk kualitas audio yang dikeluarkan layaknya anda berada di dalam bioskop.<br><br>Banyak orang yang salah kaprah mengenai fungsi dari home theater itu sendiri, sehingga timbul pertanyaan apakah home theater bagus untuk karaoke dan home theater apa yang bagus untuk karaoke. Lebih lanjut penulis jelaskan fungsi home theater ini adalah untuk audio pada saat kita menyaksikan film, atau dapat diartikan sebagai home sinema yaitu sebuah audio untuk senima (orang yang hobi menonton film).

Selain itu, sebagian besar waktu kita banyak dihabiskan di kantor.<br><br>Beda perusahaan jasa desain, beda pula hal yang mereka tawarkan. Berikut beberapa hal umum yang biasanya ditawarkan untuk ruangan Anda oleh jasa desain interior kantor.<br><br>a. Lantai<br>Pemilihan lantai yang serampangan tentu sangat tidak tepat. Memilih lantai berbahan dasar murah memang dapat menghemat anggaran, tetapi kualitas dan daya tahannya tidak dapat diandalkan. <br><br>Lantai yang baik harus melewati seleksi pertimbangan, seperti daya tahannya terhadap beban, reaksi terhadap berbagai jenis tumpahan, dan keamanan terhadap penghuninya. Kelebihan dan kekurangan bahan lantai yang Anda pilih juga harus dipertimbangkan. Misalnya, bahan keramik. <br><br>b. Jendela<br>Apakah jendela akan ditujukan untuk menciptakan suasana ruang yang terkesan lega dan besar walaupun ukuran ruangan sebenarnya kecil? Apakah jendela mengambil peran dalam pengaturan cahaya yang masuk dan keluar? Atau apakah jendela harus mengalami penyesuaian dengan jenis pintu yang dipilih pada suatu ruangan? Ya, hal-hal tersebut akan memiliki pengaruh besar terhadap desain jendela, pemilihan material jendela, serta bahan-bahan pelengkap jendela, misal jenis gorden. Hal ini memungkinkan Anda untuk menciptakan ruangan sesuai keinginan, misalnya ruangan yang terkesan lega, memiliki pencahayaan yang baik, serta tetap bisa menjadi tempat privasi. <br><br>c. Dinding<br>Perhatikan material dinding yang akan digunakan. Selain itu perlu juga diperhatikan mengenai mengenai dekorasi yang tentu saja akan berkaitan dengan teknik pengecatan. Apakah ruangan akan menggunakan cat dengan rata, atau bergradasi, atau dicat dengan efek retak. Selain itu, Anda bisa juga memasukkan bahan-bahan natural ke bagian dinding. Saat ini sudah berkembang beberapa bahan alami yang dapat dipplikasikan pada dinding, misalnya bambu, rumput, atau bebatuan. <br><br>d. Peredam Suara<br>Di zaman modern dengan ruang gerak yang semakin sempit, teknik peredaman suara yang ditawarkan oleh penyedia jasa desain interior kantor menjadi hal yang krusial. Kantor-kantor saat ini umumnya dibangun untuk menampung banyak divisi yang juga membutuhkan tempat untuk berkonsentrasi. Peredam suara akan mampu menciptakan suasana kerja yang sehat, nyaman, dan produktif. <br><br>e.Aksesori<br>Aksesori di sebuah kantor mampu membangun suasana tertentu. Ketika klien atau seseorang masuk pertama kali ke sebuah ruangan, aksesori ruangan adalah hal yang pertama kali menarik mata mereka.Kebanyakan orang menggunakan ingatan ini untuk menggambarkan atau memberik kesan terhadap sebuah ruangan. Aksesori ruang kantor tersedia dalam berbagai bahan dan bentuk. Perhatikan hal yang ditawarkan oleh jasa yang Anda pakai. Perusahaan jasa interior kantor yang berkualitas umumnya mampu menyatukan aksesori yang diterapkan untuk dinding dengan suasana ruang. Anda akan mendapatkan sebuah ruangan yang terlihat menyatu karena baik komponen besar, dinding misalnya, maupun yang kecil, rak majalah misalnya, memiliki hubungan satu sama lain. <br><br>Tentang Aplikasi<br>-------------------------<br>Desain Interior Kantor merupakan aplikasi yang berisi Kumpulan gambar desain Interior Kantor terbaru dan terlengkap.

Karakter ruang makan lebih personal, sebab di tempat inilah keluarga berkumpul, bercengkerama, dan saling bercerita sambil menikmati makanan favorit. Selain itu, ruang makan juga bisa menjadi tempat menjamu tamu (formal dine entertaining). Agar ruang makan Anda cantik dan nyaman, ada beberapa tip untuk Anda.<br><br>    Setelah memilih meja makan, tentukan bentuk kursi makan dan sesuaikan tinggi kursi dengan tinggi meja. Pilihlah kombinasi paling nyaman dan seimbang. Ketika duduk, tinggi meja berada di atas perut dan masih di bawah dada.<br><br>    Ruang makan harus terang, baik bersumber dari cahaya alami atau melalui penerangan khusus. Sebaiknya letakkan meja dan kursi makan dekat jendela. Tambahkan lampu gantung di atas meja untuk menerangi makanan yang tersaji.<br><br>    Pilihlah warna yang mampu membangkitkan selera makan, seperti warna merah, oranye, atau hijau yang dapat dijadikan aksen segar. Padukan dengan warna netral atau warna tanah, seperti cokelat muda, krem, hitam, atau putih.<br><br>    Manfaatkan dinding ruang makan untuk kabinet pantry, rak penyimpan terbuka, atau memajang lukisan. Bila ingin lebih personal, tambahkan partisi ringan sebagai pembatas ruang makan dengan ruang lain.<br><br>    Sesuaikan bentuk dan karakter meja makan dengan ukuran ruang dan tema desain.<br><br>    Untuk mengantisipasi kebutuhan meja pesta, beli dan gunakan dua meja persegi (satu meja untuk makan keluarga, lainnya untuk pesta). Bila keluarga besar datang atau ada tamu khusus yang perlu dijamu, satukan dua meja itu. Secara instan, Anda memiliki satu meja persegi panjang untuk jamuan makan formal atau informal.<br><br>    Pilih kursi makan yang nyaman, yaitu kursi yang bersandaran tegak. Sandaran punggung tinggi berkesan formal, sementara yang lebih rendah informal. Dudukan kursi makan harus rata, jangan yang terlalu empuk agar badan tidak ‘tenggelam’ saat kursi diduduki.<br><br>    Meja dengan permukaan bahan yang bertekstur kasar sebaiknya dilapisi dengan lembaran kaca tembus pandang yang kuat atau sejenis tempered glass. Permukaan meja yang sudah di-finish rata dan mengilap bisa langsung digunakan. Bisa juga dengan menambahkan runner di tengah meja atau hanya alas piring.<br><br>Tentang Aplikasi<br>-------------------------<br>Desain Ruang Makan merupakan aplikasi yang berisi Kumpulan gambar desain Ruang Makan terbaru dan terlengkap.

So much press is given to the necessity of bees, butterflies and ladybugs for a healthy garden. But the lumpy, bumpy (perhaps even a bit ugly) toad is incredibly valuable in the garden. They are voracious carnivores that eat many of the pests that wreak havoc on plants.  They love slugs, flies and pretty much anything they can fit in thier mouth. An adult toad can eat up to 1,000 insects each night! How should you reward the unsung amphibious garden hero? Build it a house!<br><br>Supplies : <br><br>    air dry terracotta clay <br>    artificial leaf (or real)<br>    mini rolling pin<br>    clay needle tool<br>    paint brush<br>    craft paints<br>    polyurethane<br><br>1. Cut a hunk of clay about the size of a softball. It will be stiff right out of the package. You will need to “wedge” it to help soften it up and get the air bubbles out. You do this by slapping the piece of clay down onto a hard surface. Then, compress the clay down and pick it up and do it again. Do not knead the clay. Repeat the slapping/compressing steps a few times. You will feel the clay soften up to become the right consistency.<br><br>2. Roll out the piece of clay. If you want the clay to be an even thickness, use a rolling pin and 1/4 inch slats. This will ensure the clay to be a uniform 1/4 inch thickness.<br><br>3. Lay the leaf onto the clay. Use a smaller roller to gently press the leaf onto the surface.<br><br>4. Once you have the leaf impression, use a needle tool to carefully cut around the impression.<br><br>5. Gently remove the excess clay from the leaf (or leaves). Place cut-out leaf form onto a small curved surface like a small upturned bowl or, in this case, a shell, to help them dry with a small opening for the toads. Cover with a plastic bag and let the leaf dry for 24-48 hours. The key is to let it dry slowly. If it dries too quickly, it can crack.<br><br>6. Once the leaf is dry, use craft paint to give it some color. If your leaf toad house will be in an area exposed to weather, add a protective coat of polyurethane.<br><br>7.

Browse these kitchen cabinet painting projects and ideas to get started.<br><br>Painting your kitchen cabinets is a process that requires patience, and you’ll have to be prepared to deal with a bit of chaos and disorder for a few weeks before all of the pieces can be put back together.<br><br>- Choose the right paint. Everyday wall paint consists of a formula not suited for surfaces like cabinetry. It’s known to chip and it won’t stand up well to repeated cleaning.<br><br>- Choose a color that will flatter your appliances. Consider this: I had a lot of older, black appliances in the kitchen in my old house. They stood out like a sore thumb surrounded by oak cabinetry.<br><br>- Remove all of the hardware. All of the hinges. Every last screw. The knob. The magnets that help to keep the door shut. It takes time, but it’s worth it to have a clean slate when you begin refinishing the surfaces.<br><br>- Take the time to organize the hardware. One of the best tips I came across was to label each door by number beneath where the hinge goes in the frame. Label a plastic baggie filled with that door’s hardware with the same number. Place a small piece of painter's tape over the number on the door, so when the painting is complete, you can remove the painter's tape and see the number. <br><br><br>Want to know more ? <br>Download this application now and get what you want here. worth to try and you will like it.<br>simply share through any social media platforms. thank you for downloading. please enjoy and give us any feedback.</div>"	"0.00"	"House & Home"	"0"

Every single option here is a unique expression, highlighting the range of permutations that the humble fence has seen in recent times.<br>Before a guest even sees your kitchen, living room, foyer, or home theatre, the first thing they notice is the fence in your front yard. There are a lot of fence designs available. Although installation can be a little complicated. Not planning ahead things can lead to delays and complications. The first thing to decide on is which fence styles will work best for your yard. Take the time to learn about fences. Understand their functionality, material used, purpose, and height. A good understanding of these attributes is essential before calling a fencing contractor. Without proper research, you may not get a fence that fits your requirements.<br>One of the first things to know is where to place your new fence? Are you enclosing your yard to define a property line or just to add aesthetic value? Is it for the front yard or the backyard. A front yard fence needs to give your home curb appeal and compliment its surroundings. This is more so than if the fence was for the backyard. It could be a fence for keeping pets and/or children in and protecting them against street traffic. Knowing the primary goal of your fence helps to determine what type of fence will be the most appropriate.<br>decorative fence designs in nice neighborhood<br>When it comes to backyard fencing, there are many reasons to have them. Some of those reasons are the same as having a front yard fencing. Fencing can always enhance the aesthetic appeal of a space. However, they also serve other functions. Backyard fences, for example, can help keep your landscape enclosed and under control. It also separates your backyard from the neighbors, keeping things neatly separated. It also serves many of the same functions as the front yard, such as keeping children and pets safe and protected.<br>Fences make very nice boundaries that not only keep things in but also keep things out. It can be a burglar deterrent, however small, and also help to keep a lot of wild critters away from your house. Some fences have barbed wire on them to discourage people and animals from coming into your yard. Some fences come equipped with electric hooked to them to deliver a shock to anything that touches it. These types of fences are really good for security.<br>A lot of homeowners love to have friends over and eat out back on a picnic table or porch setting. Having a fence keeps people from just walking up on you while you’re entertaining. It gives you much needed privacy as well as a sense of security.</div>"	"0.00"	"House & Home"	"11"

If you don’t have any seasonal tea towels on hand, you can easily use fabrics with floral prints or cute illustrations to make seat cushions that will accent your home decor all year round!<br><br>here we share you a tutorial of making Scandinavian Christmas DIY Cushion.<br><br>directions:<br>- Fold the towel in corect size. Trim the edges. Save the scrap (we recommend to make mug rug/ little table mat  with that).<br><br>- Measure how big piece you need to add. fold on purpose the down edge more than the up edge. The piece you will now add, should be about 2/3 from the size of your cushion.<br><br>- For the extra piece, use table cloth fabric. It has still selvage and don’t cut that away but sew the finished edge of the towel straight on the selvadge.<br><br>- fold twice the other edge of the red fabric and sew a straight line there. White fabric/tea towel has ready finished edge.<br><br>- if you like to add something on your cushion, do that before sewing the sides.<br><br>- Now fold the right sides together. Red fabric is against the print because that will be the outside part of the envelope. White is the most outside because that will be the inside part of the envelope.<br><br>- Sew the sides with straight stitch and with sik sak.<br><br>- And there you are! you loooove this simple Scandinavian style cushion!<br><br>for further information and detail tutorial, download this now and grab what you want.<br>please enjoy this Scandinavian Christmas DIY Cushion and give us any feedback.</div>"	"0.00"	"House & Home"	"0"

It is usually sold in rolls and is applied onto a wall using wallpaper paste. Wallpapers can come plain as ""lining paper"" (so that it can be painted or used to help cover uneven surfaces and minor wall defects thus giving a better surface), textured (such as Anaglypta), with a regular repeating pattern design, or, much less commonly today, with a single non-repeating large design carried over a set of sheets. The smallest rectangle that can be tiled to form the whole pattern is known as the pattern repeat.<br><br>Wallpaper printing techniques include surface printing, gravure printing, silk screen-printing, rotary printing, and digital printing. Wallpaper is made in long rolls, which are hung vertically on a wall. Patterned wallpapers are designed so that the pattern ""repeats"", and thus pieces cut from the same roll can be hung next to each other so as to continue the pattern without it being easy to see where the join between two pieces occurs.<br>In the case of large complex patterns of images this is normally achieved by starting the second piece halfway into the length of the repeat, so that if the pattern going down the roll repeats after 24 inches, the next piece sideways is cut from the roll to begin 12 inches down the pattern from the first. The number of times the pattern repeats horizontally across a roll does not matter for this purpose. A single pattern can be issued in several different colorways.<br><br>Vintage wallpaper has been our passion for years.

For example, the lamp for the living room would be different from the bedroom lamps, as well as for other indoor lights such as a lamp children's learning space and others. As a light source, especially at night, the lights running a very important role for each of the intricacies of the house. Lamps kitchen, den, living room and another others must have been brighter than the light sleeper example. Speaking Sleep lights usually is imagined by us is a unique shape, less luminous in a cool design and creative. Choosing the bedroom lights must consider the character of the occupants of the room, because everyone has the character and his own pleasure during sleep. In some people there who wanted her bedroom is always light at the time he fell asleep, because he pobia dark for example. There is also a person who likes to turn off the lights because she could not sleep with the condition of the rooms are brightly lit and not a few who liked his room dim or well-lit. Special like a rather dim light sleeper is usually a light sleeper who choose to design a wide variety of unique shapes, cool and creative. Currently, many design choices of ambient light that we can adopt in order to design the interior of the house specifically for this illumination.

Avoid using design bedroom lights were blinding, because the lights as it can disrupt your sleep comfort.<br>2. Choose the appropriate lamp design, or at least resembles the design of your bedroom to look fit.<br>3. Placement of lights is also very influential in your comfort during sleep and the beauty of the interior design of the room itself, of course.<br>4.

When set to smart watering mode, b-hyve takes the guesswork out of watering and utilizes Mother Nature, along with some really great technology, to determine the watering schedule for your yard.  When set and left in smart watering mode, b-hyve can save users as much as 50% more water over a traditional controller. <br><br> Weather<br><br>When set in smart mode, b-hyve uses local weather data to determine how much water is evaporated and transpired through your plants each day to know when it needs to water.  It also accounts for any rainfall that is in the forecast, shuts off the system for rain, then looks back to see how much actually fell.  That’s smart!  But all yards are not the same.  B-hyve also takes into account things like soil type, plant type, sun/shade and slope to determine a watering schedule that takes the water to the roots and helps avoid runoff. <br><br> WeatherSense<br><br>If you want to be the one in control of the schedule, that’s okay too.  With b-hyve you can set custom programs to water how you want while still taking advantage of the local weather data to override watering in case of a weather event.  This will shut off your system during the rain and resume your program when the rain has passed.  That’s smart!<br><br>Integrated Irrigation Audit Tool<br><br>The b-hyve app also integrates the award-winning irrigation audit tool right to your smart device.  By performing a catch cup test on your sprinkler system, you will know exactly how much water is being applied rather than relying on estimated sprinkler head water use that other timers/apps use, which can be off by as much as 50%, saving you more water and money.   <br><br>This is the app for the best-selling, WaterSense and SWAT certified Orbit B-hyve Smart Wifi Sprinkler Timer.

""Hey Google, talk to Switchmate""<br>- Updates: get over the air firmware updates for your Switchmate device(s) to make sure you have the latest/greatest<br>- Voice Control: Use the mic icon in the app to control your lights with your voice, see below for more details!<br><br>Some of the Features we're working on:<br>- Widgets: Add them to your Home Screen so you don't have to open the app to toggle switches or use voice commands!<br>- Grouping: Create &amp; control groups of devices together.<br>- Timeout: Automatically turn off a switch after X amount of time!<br>- Android Wear: Because who doesn't want to use their watch to do all this?<br>- API &amp; Tasker/IFTTT Plugins: Per your requests, we're still in the early planning stages on this one but we're working on it!<br><br>Voice Control Feature:<br>You can click the Microphone icon in the app and simply say your command - voice activation tries to first match by the switch name that shows in your list of devices (and you can change under Device Settings), but if it can't find that it will try to match to the location you selected when you first setup your Switchmate(s).

Here are some examples:<br>""Turn Kenny's Room light off""<br>""Turn on my living room lights""<br>""Turn all my lights off""<br>""Bedroom on""<br><br>Permissions:<br>- Location Permissions are unfortunately required for BLE by Android - we're huge on privacy and unfortunately there is no way around not requiring Location to be enabled on Android because we cannot scan for BLE devices without it, and that is why the app will not function without it. Beyond that we do use location data only when Welcome Home is enabled so we can tell you're nearing home in order to optimize battery (so we're not looking for Switchmates all the time!). This data is often cached from other apps and we simply grab that data so in most cases we aren't making new location checks - and that data is NEVER transmitted off your phone/to us at all.<br>- Background Service &amp; Waking your device permissions are also used for Welcome Home so we can ping your Switchmate to let it know you're home without the app needing to be open.<br>- Internet permissions are used for checking for firmware updates &amp; sending us crash reports (via Google Crashlytics)<br>- Bluetooth &amp; WiFi permissions are required for communicating with your Switchmate devices.<br><br>Requirements:<br>- Switchmate Device(s) of course!<br>- Android 4.4.4+ is required so we can use Bluetooth Low Energy in order to save a lot of battery!<br><br>Switchmate devices are currently only sold in the US and Canada</div>"	"0.00"	"House & Home"	"645"

In contemplating the various needs for wedding flowers, you might consider how many flowers you need, who they are for and if you want flowers for the ceremony and reception itself. <br>As you research wedding flowers that fit the overall theme and design of your big day, putting together a quick list of wedding flowers you are interested in will help guide you and your wedding florist in making final decisions.<br><br>A wedding flower list will also help focus your flower discussions and help you stay within your floral budget. Having a general checklist is a good first start, and it is best to consider the following wedding flowers as a general guide rather than a must-have. <br>In addition to this list of wedding flowers, you may also wish to add corsages or boutonnieres for other wedding guests that are special to the bride and the groom.<br><br>Flowers are indispensable items in most weddings around the world, because they generally symbolize love and beauty. They determine the color and tone of a wedding ceremony, and they are a representation of the bride and groom’s personal tastes.<br>Certainly, any wedding will not be complete without a splendorous display of flowers.<br><br>When selecting flowers, wedding couples should take certain things into consideration. First of all, they have to choose flowers that are suitable for the seasons in which their weddings will be held. Those who are planning to wed in spring should opt for flowers such as tulips, hyacinths, peonies, forsythias, and lilies, while summer weddings should feature irises, gladiolas, columbines, blue delphiniums, roses, chrysanthemums, snapdragons, and cockscombs. Some suitable flowers for autumn weddings include dahlias, crab apples, ranunculus, and ornamental cabbages, and winter wedding flowers include amaryllises, cymbidium orchids, red tropical anthuriums, and others. Flowers that are in season are more affordable, and they can help wedding couples save a substantial amount of money.<br><br>It is also important that couples consider wedding trends while they are choosing flowers. Nowadays, florists have come up with many new floral arrangement styles that can make weddings more unique and memorable. One of the hottest trends now is to use flowers to embellish cupcake towers, in the same way that wedding cakes are decorated. Unique flower arrangements can turn traditional wedding items, such as the unity candle, into something truly distinctive and personal. Wedding couples can use the right flower arrangements to personalize their weddings.<br><br>When it comes to choosing your wedding flowers, most couples will have an idea of the colours they like and maybe even the shapes, but perhaps not the flower names.<br>Once you know the names of the flowers you love, you can start thinking about what wedding bouquet style would work for your wedding and whether the flowers you like are in season and talk to your wedding florist about what you want.<br><br>We teamed up with flower experts Interflora to get their expert advice on wedding flower names, what they’re useful for and when it’s best to get them.<br>Learn how to choose wedding flowers and how to make some of the arrangements yourself from Expert floral designer in these Application videos.<br><br>         ✰✰✰ Support Us By Rating Us 5 ★★★★★ ✰✰✰  <br> ✰✰✰ Please contact us first if you have any question! ✰✰✰<br> ""</div>"	"0.00"	"House & Home"	"0"

Turn on medium heat and stir constantly until soap has dissolved into the water.<br>3.	Let cool completely and pour into the container you plan to use.<br>4.	It will take about 24 hours to completely “gel” but it will not be quite as thick as regular hand soap.<br><br><br>HOMEMADE SOAP MOLDS<br><br>1.	Use a handsaw to cut a 1-foot-long piece from the 10-foot-long PVC pipe. Clean any rough ends or edges with a file or sandpaper.<br>2.

It is one of the components that make it possible to intelligently control your prefabricated garage. Use it to conveniently control the sectional door of your ZAPF prefab garage with your smartphone. <br><br>ZAPF Connect can do more: It allows you to easily control you ZAPF prefab garage via your smartphone. Open and close the door with a single tap. Already when approaching your garage, the app asks you via the lock screen whether you would like to open your garage.<br><br>With the Sensor H + T, the door can automatically be brought to the ventilation position. When this is done, the sectional door opens a small crack for air circulation, allowing the garage to dry. In combination with the ZAPF premium sectional door, this ensures that the door does not lift up off the ground when in the ventilation position. <br><br>Always up to date: ZAPF Connect informs you whether the garage door is open or closed even when you are on the road. For you, this equates to even more convenience and security. <br><br>As unique as you are: With ZAPF Connect, you can easily customize your garage to your own habits. Recurring workflows can be pre-configured by you, the user, and your garage will perform them automatically for your convenience.<br><br>Light: The Philips Hue lighting system can now also be integrated via the app. This allows you to control when and where additional lighting is switched on and off.<br><br>ZAPF Connect is future-proof: It is designed as an open system, which means you can also expand it with add-ons in the future. Existing ZAPF prefab garages can also be retrofitted with ZAPF Connect as part of modernization measures. <br><br>State of the art: ZAPF Connect utilizes secure 256-bit encryption. This ensures that the connection is secure. Over-the-air updates for the ZAPF Box serve the same purpose. Furthermore, new functions will also be made available via the updates. <br><br>Five components: The ZAPF Connect app works in combination with the ZAPF Box (which allows the entire system to be controlled), the ZAPF Stick (which connects the Box with the door motor), the Sensor H + T, and a light barrier. The latter prevents the door from closing when persons or objects are located in the door area.

Questa nuova tecnologia consente davvero di avere tutto ciò che abbiamo sempre sognato, nel massimo della sicurezza, ma soprattutto con dei costi di realizzazione che sono ben più contenuti di quelli dell’edilizia tradizionale.

Use your phone as a portable thermostat control!<br><br>In contrast to the manufacturer's cloud management, this app is local with instant access and response.  Being local there's no security risk to your network (externally connected devices can serve as bridges to break into your home network) so you can disable the thermostat from accessing the internet.  The app allows you to access your thermostat (locally) even when that cloud service or your internet connection is down.  No more shivering/sweating, waiting and wondering - you can make and see the change instantly.  Keep an android phone or tablet by your bed as an alarm clock and handy thermostat.<br><br>Use the thermostat widget so you can see what's going on at a glance.  <br><br>If you need to change temperature settings while away from home you can continue to use the Radio Thermostat cloud service or for secure access run your own cloud service using AutomationManager.<br><br>For advanced automation you'll want to use AutomationManager (see the developers site for details).  Using it you can define enhanced schedules, control temperature using location detection, and other similar automation including voice control with Google Home or Amazon Alexa.  To use AutomationManager you'll want to both it and this app in server/hub mode together on a dedicated android device.<br><br>This really is a free app, not ad supported! If you would like to support the development of this application and others like it, consider purchasing and using AutomationManager.<br><br>Note - this app only supports functions provided by the CT-30 API.  Functions such as holiday mode, filter, etc, are cannot be provided.  Consider using AutomationManager to provide similar advanced functions and more.<br><br>NOTE: The CT-30 API is a built in web server that tends to be a little unstable and occasionally drops requests from the app.  When this happens (or when your phone is not able to connect to the thermostat) the widget and the app will show ?'s instead of the temperature.  It will attempt to reconnect every few minutes (less often if not on wifi).<br><br>This app uses the internal URL (IP) and the manufacturer's unprotected local API to control the thermostat.  It is for use within your home only. Do not expose your thermostat URL outside of your home network!  The thermostat does not provide security to protect it's URL or data, and this app cannot add security on it's own.</div>"	"0.00"	"House & Home"	"6"

However, you will have to stay in it for the long haul in order to make it work for you. <br><br> <br><br>If this is your first foray with this, you will want to weigh your options as far as how you will purchase your initial property.  Not a lot of people have the entire amount up front to purchase the property with cash. <br><br> <br><br>So, instead of saving, some people will go ahead and get a loan in order to get started.  Some experts say that it is better to wait and save your money first.  This way, the monthly income that comes in will go to you instead of the lender.  You will also be able to build wealth quicker by paying the entire amount in cash. <br><br> <br><br>However, it is still possible that a bank will loan you the money you need in order to get the property.  If you go this route, make sure that you have some backup funds in the event you get in a financial rut.  At least you will still be able to pay on the loan. <br><br> <br><br>Of course, the better situation is to have all of the money up front and pay cash outright for it.

В течение всего дня растение ""вдыхает"" углекислый газ и ""выдыхает"" кислород, ночью - наоборот. Большей частью это происходит через крохотные устьица на листьях, которые открываются, когда происходит процесс обмена веществ. Однако если в сухом воздухе жилых помещений листья начинают увядать, они закрываются.<br><br>То же происходит, когда на листьях оседает пыль или когда их ""полируют"" средствами для блеска. Все это прерывает жизненно важный процесс фотосинтеза. Только зеленое растение в состоянии из углекислого газа и воды синтезировать сахар и клетчатку В виде углекислого газа оно всасывает из воздуха основную составную часть своего питания, при этом его листва выглядит зеленой и здоровой.<br><br>Как в жизни не все друзья оказываются верными, так и не все домашние цветы полезными. Приобретая растения, надо узнать о них как можно больше, будет ли ваша семья блаженствовать вместе с вами от соседства с ними или кто-то из близких будет чувствовать дискомфорт.<br><br>Вот для чего надо внимательно вчитываться в советы садоводов, выбирая цветы для своего дома.

"vn.com.wedo.thuocloban"	"Thước Lỗ Ban"	"10000"	"4.7"	"<div jsname=""sngebd"">Từ xa xưa, việc xây dựng nhà theo Phong thủy đã là một nguyên tắc ăn sâu vào tiềm thức mỗi người Việc Nam. Hai yếu tố hàng đầu để xây nhà hợp Phong thủy là Vị và Hướng (có câu: nhất Vị nhì Hướng). Sau khi có Vị và Hướng rồi thì cần xem xét đến vấn đề kích thước chi tiết của từng đối tượng phù hợp với Phong thủy.<br><br>Thước Lỗ Ban giúp bạn tra cứu kích thước các đối tượng hợp Phong thủy. Thước Lỗ Ban được đặt tên theo người đầu tiên nghiên cứu và lập nên thước có tên là Lỗ Ban.<br><br>Sau rất nhiều năm đúc kết, Thước Lỗ Ban hiện được xây dựng trên kết quả của nghiên cứu cũng như chiêm nghiệm thực tế và được đưa ra thành quy luật để tra cứu, ứng dụng trong kiến trúc và xây dựng công trình, các sản phẩm nội thất cũng như các công tác liên quan đến âm phần (mộ, huyệt...).<br><br>Hiện tại có rất nhiều Thước Lỗ Ban được lưu truyền trong cuộc sống, nhưng có ba thước được tra cứu và sử dụng nhiều nhất là Thước Lỗ Ban 52cm, Thước 42,9cm, Thước 39cm. Các thước này được ứng dụng vào việc tra cứu các kích thước của các đối tượng khác nhau. Trên mỗi thước (ứng với chiều dài tương ứng với tên thước) được chia thành các cung khác nhau, trong đó có các cung tốt (thường ký hiệu màu đỏ) và cung xấu (thường ký hiệu mầu đen). Và chúng ta thường tra cứu lấy các cung nằm trong kích thước màu đỏ để sử dụng, cung đỏ nào thì tùy vào mục đích chúng ta cần. Hết mỗi một chiều dài thước (ứng với tên thước) thì các cung lại lặp lại từ đầu cho đến vô cùng....<br><br>Wedo Architecture &amp; Construction (http://wedo.com.vn) là công ty hàng đầu trong lĩnh vực tư vấn thiết kế kiến trúc và xây dựng Việt Nam. Chúng tôi là những đơn vị đầu tiên đưa và đẩy mạnh viêc sử dụng kích thước theo Thước Lỗ Ban hợp phong thủy trong Kiến trúc và Xây dựng ở Việt Nam.<br><br>Sau một thời gian dài sử dụng và đúc kết, Wedo xây dựng phần mềm Thước Lỗ Ban trên website http://thuocloban.com và nay là ứng dụng Thước Lỗ Ban trên thiết bị di động để giúp mọi người có thể tra cứu nhanh kích thước tốt hợp phong thủy trong cuộc sống.<br><br>Thước Lỗ Ban được sử dụng theo nguyên tắc sau:<br>Thước Bỗ Ban 52cm - Sử dụng trong Kiến trúc &amp; Xây Dựng đo khoảng thông thủy, lọt sáng...<br>Thước Lỗ Ban 42,9cm - Sử dụng trong Dương Trạch - kích thước cho các đồ vật, hình khối...<br>Thước Lỗ Ban 39cm - Sử dụng trong các vấn đề liên quan đến Âm Phần - Bàn Thờ, mộ, huyệt...<br><br>Mọi góp ý xin gửi về email: wedojsc@wedo.vn<br><br>Rất mong ứng dụng của chúng tôi giúp ích cho các bạn trong cuộc sống!</div>"	"0.00"	"House & Home"	"159"
