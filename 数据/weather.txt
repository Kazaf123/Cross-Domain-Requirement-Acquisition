Most of the country is fairly temperate, but some of the most visited areas, such as hot, humid Buenos Aires and the cold, arid Patagonian Andes, feature extreme weather. The ideal time to visit one region may be the worst time to visit another, so pairing more than one region in the same trip can make planning and packing difficult.<br><br>Tropical and Sub-tropical Regions :<br><br>Steer clear of Northern Argentina in the summer, when scorching heat and humid air makes sightseeing unpleasant at best. Argentina's tropical and sub-tropical provinces include Chaco, Corrientes, Formosa, Misiones and Santiago del Estero, as well as portions of Salta, Santa Fe and Tucumán. These areas are characterized by high temperatures year-round and plentiful rain fall, with no dry season at all in the inland subtropical areas. Visit these areas during the Argentine winter -- which occurs during North American summer -- when the weather is milder and drier.<br><br>Temperate Areas :<br><br>The bulk of central Argentina, including the Pampas farmland, Cordoba Hills, Mar de Plata and Buenos Aires, enjoys a moderate climate with hot, humid summers and cool, dry winters. January and February -- summer in the Southern Hemisphere -- see temperatures in the high 90s and 100s. Since this is also the main vacation period for Argentines and a heavy travel time, it's best to visit the region in the spring, when temperatures and humidity are milder.<br><br><br>Arid Sections :<br><br>Argentina's mountainous and foothill regions, including the Andes, La Rioja and San Juan, all feature an arid climate, which turns cold and windy in the Patagonian Andes. The best time to visit Patagonia for hiking and water sports is the summer when temperatures warm up and the snow clears. If you are looking to hit the slopes for some skiing, be prepared for high prices and packed hotels during July and August, when Argentines from Buenos Aires make their way to the mountains in droves.<br><br>Sub-polar Regions :<br><br>The Tierra del Fuego got its name from Magellan, who spotted early inhabitants' fires along the coast. It is not a fiery hot region by any means. The mainland and islands of the province are actually cold throughout the year, with temperatures rarely even creeping up past the 60s in the summer. However, since the surrounding ocean moderates temperature spikes, winters in the region are not as cold as the southern latitude would suggest. More than frigid, the area is plagued by heavy storms made of rain, snow or a slushy mix.<br><br>Features :<br><br>- We show you the next 6 days forecast<br><br>- Different color for different weather<br><br>- A widget is integrated to see weather from your home screen<br><br>- 5 beauty theme available<br><br>- 9 available weather wap (Temperature, Wind Speed, Precipitation, Rain, Snow, Cloud, Sea Pressure)<br><br>- Uses GPS location to detect your location</div>"	"0.00"	"Weather"	"95"

We are a team of highly skilled people dedicated to working to give you the best.<br><br>Australia is a continent that experiences a variety of climates due to its size. The temperature can range from below zero in the Snowy Mountains in southern Australia to extreme heat in the Kimberley region in the north-west of the continent.<br><br>Due to the size of the continent, there is not one single seasonal calendar for the entire continent. Instead there are six climatic zones and this translates as two main seasonal patterns.<br><br>There is a Summer / Autumn / Winter / Spring pattern in the Temperate zone, also affecting the Desert and the Grassland climatic zones and, a Wet / Dry pattern in the tropical north which includes the Equatorial, Tropical and sub-tropical zones.<br><br>Depending upon where you are each Month, the season will vary on whether the weather is defined by the Temperate zone seasons or the tropical seasons.<br><br>Cyclones are a tropical weather phenomenon. They are usually encountered in Australia between November and April, and they mostly take place in the north of the country. The Western Australian and Northern Territory coasts, as well as the Queensland coast, are the usual places that cyclones occur.<br><br>About six cyclones happen in Australia every year. By far the most famous cyclone in Australia is Cyclone Tracy, which hit Darwin in the Northern Territory on Christmas Eve 1974. Forty-nine people died as a result, and over 600 people were injured. Darwin had to be evacuated because over eighty per cent of the city was destroyed. But Tracy is not the worst cyclone to ever visit Australia. In 1899, Cyclone Mahina killed over 400 people when it destroyed an entire pearl-fishing fleet at Bathurst Bay in Queensland.<br><br>We cover the major ,cities of Australia especially  Sydney Melbourne Brisbane Perth Adelaide Gold Coast Canberra Newcastle Central Coast Wollongong Geelong Hobart Townsville Thuringowa Cairns Cairns Toowoomba Ballarat Darwin Bendigo Launceston Rockingham Rockhampton Mackay Maitland Mandurah Bunbury Tweed Heads Bundaberg Wagga Wagga Albury Port Macquarie Hervey Bay Shepparton-Mooroopna Tamworth Melton Orange Dubbo Queanbeyan Kalgoorlie-Boulder Mildura Wodonga Lismore Bathurst Warrnambool Gladstone Coffs Harbour Windsor Richmond Geraldton.<br><br>Features :<br><br>- We show you the next 6 days forecast<br><br>- Different color for different weather<br><br>- A widget is integrated to see weather from your home screen<br><br>- 5 beauty theme available<br><br>- 9 available weather wap<br><br>- Uses GPS location to detect your location</div>"	"0.00"	"Weather"	"6"

We are a team of highly skilled people dedicated to working to give you the best.<br><br>Bangladesh has a subtropical monsoon climate characterized by wide seasonal variations in rainfall, high temperatures and humidity. There are three distinct seasons in Bangladesh: a hot, humid summer from March to June; a cool, rainy monsoon season from June to October; and a cool, dry winter from October to March. In general, maximum summer temperatures range between 30°C and 40°C. April is the warmest month in most parts of the country. January is the coldest month, when the average temperature for most of the country is about 10°C. <br><br>Heavy rainfall is characteristic of Bangladesh. With the exception of the relatively dry western region of Rajshahi, where the annual rainfall is about 1600 mm, most parts of the country receive at least 2000 mm of rainfall per year. Because of its location just south of the foothills of the Himalayas, where monsoon winds turn west and northwest, the regions in northeastern Bangladesh receives the greatest average precipitation, sometimes over 4000 mm per year. About 80 percent of Bangladesh's rain falls during the monsoon season. <br><br>The Typhoon season begins in August and lasts to end November. Warnings are not always very effective in Bangladesh, due to the bad Infrastructure of this country. Be careful when you travel around in the coastal areas of Bangladesh in this period, and try to follow the weather forecasts carefully.

Winter is mild with some rain, but usually it is bright, sunny days with cold nights.<br><br>During the summertime, sun protection is the most important single consideration for an Egypt trip, especially for the fair-skinned. Wearing a sunhat is essential. Cheap, and pure cotton, sunhats are made locally and available everywhere. Travel clothing should be light and comfortable, 100% cotton clothing is the best and robust shoes are a must! The climate of Egypt is characterized by a hot season from May to October and a cool season from October to May. Extreme temperatures during both seasons are moderated by the prevailing northern winds.<br><br>-In the coastal region average annual temperatures range from a maximum of 37° C (99° F) to a minimum of 14° C (57° F). Wide variations of temperature occur in the deserts, ranging from a maximum of 46° C (114° F), during daylight hours, to a minimum of 6° C (42° F) after sunset. During the winter season desert temperatures often drop to 0° C (32° F). <br><br>The most humid area is along the Mediterranean coast, where the average annual rainfall is about 200mm. Precipitation decreases rapidly to the south; Cairo receives on average only about 29mm of rain each year, and in many desert locations it may rain only once in several years! <br><br>There are 5 days called Khamsin between March and April, when sandstorms can occur sporadically, blowing in different places according to the wind direction.<br><br>Winter (between October and May) weather is colder than most people anticipate, and cold winds blow over the desert at sunrise and sunset. Even when it is warm outside, it can be surprisingly cold inside the massive stone Temples. In winter, showers can fall everywhere, so bring a few items of light but warm clothing, so that you can cope with the cold early mornings and the occasional, and unseasonable, cold snap.<br><br>Bring one or two dressy outfits along for evenings out, especially for parties, and special occasions or just to get out of your tour clothes!

There is a chance of a downpour in spring or a thunderstorm in summer. Temperature ranges between 20°C and 26°C from May through October. Springtime in Paris is mild and relatively dry, and the autumn is equally extended. July and August are the warmest months. Daily average maximum temperatures range from 6°C in January to 26°C in August. The wettest month on average is October (71 mm), when heavy Thunderstorms are possible. Brittany in the far west is the wettest French locale, especially between October and November. July is the driest month for the Bretons.<br><br>In the South, the Mediterranean coast has the driest climate with any noticeable rain coming in spring and autumn. Provence (in the southeast) occasionally plays reluctant host to le mistral, a strong, cold and dry wind that blows in over the winter for periods of only a few days up to a couple of weeks.The Mediterranean coastline and Corsica have plenty of sunshine during the summer months, and refreshing sea breezes. Average daily maximum temperatures reach a warm 27°C in August, and an average of 12 hours of sunshine per day. 25-30 dry days per month can be expected during the summer season. On the Atlantic Coast and in Bordeaux, the climate is generally mild with temperatures averaging 11°C in winter, up to 27°C in summer, and rainfall distributed throughout the year. With the days fresh and possibly damp in the spring and often sunny in the autumn, the climate is one of the most important factors behind Bordeaux's high quality wine it produces. <br><br>The weather in the French Alps varies from north to south. The northern Alps (the Savoy) are subject to oceanic influences resulting in abundant precipitation year round with low temperatures, and cold winters with sometimes heavy snowfall. Briancon, in the Alps, has a mean temperature of -2°C in January, and 17°C in July. During the warm season, local winds blow along this region's wide valleys and by midday, warm air rises from the valleys, causing clouds to form around most mountain summits. The heights can sometimes attract storms that are both violent and spectacular. The southern Alps (Provence and the Cote D'Azur) enjoy a typical Mediterranean climate, with lots of sunshine, dry weather, clear skies and no mist or fog. Autumn is the best time of year in this region. Occasionally, violent storms may occur, but they are always followed by sunny spells. <br><br>Features :<br><br>- We show you the next 6 Days Forecast<br><br>- Different color for different weather<br><br>- A Widget is Integrated to see weather from your home screen<br><br>- 5 beauty theme available<br><br>- 9 Available Weather Map<br><br>- Uses GPS Location to detect your location</div>"	"0.00"	"Weather"	"8"

Northwestern and coastal Germany have a maritime influenced climate which is characterized by warm summers and mild cloudy winters. Most areas on the country's North Sea coast have midwinter temperatures about 1.5°C or even higher. Farther inland, the climate is continental, marked by greater seasonal variations in temperature, with warmer summers and colder winters. Temperature extremes between night and day and summer and winter are considerably less in the north than in the south. During January, the coldest month, the average temperature is about 1.5°C in the north and about -2°C in the south. In July, the warmest month, it is cooler in the north than in the south. The northern coastal region has July temperatures averaging between 16°C and 18°C; at some locations in the south, the average is almost 20°C or even slightly higher. <br><br>In addition to the maritime and continental climates that predominate over most of the country, the Alpine regions in the extreme south and, to a lesser degree, some areas of the Central German Uplands have a so-called mountain climate. This climate is characterized by lower temperatures because of higher altitudes and greater precipitation caused by air becoming moisture-laden as it lifts over higher terrain. An occasional condition in the Alps is called ""föhn"", or warm wind. In this atmospheric condition, warm tropical air is drawn across the Alps and loses moisture on the southern slopes of the mountains. Sometimes this winds can be as strong as gales, and can cause damage, especially in late autumn and winter. <br><br>Especially in fall and winter strong atlantic low-pressure systems can bring gales and uncomfortable weather with showers, thunderstorms and heavy rain, especially in the western coastal parts and the mountainous regions of Germany; in summer times weaker low pressure systems can cause showery weather, and sometimes even (severe) thunderstorms. winters in Germany are generally mild, but can sometimes be harsh with heavy snowfall and temperatures far below zero, especially in the eastern, southern and mountainous regions. <br><br>Features :<br><br>- We show you the next 6 Days Forecast<br><br>- Different color for different weather<br><br>- A Widget is Integrated to see weather from your home screen<br><br>- 5 beauty theme available<br><br>- 9 Available Weather Map (Temperature, Wind Speed, Precipitation, Rain, Rain Classic, Snow, Cloud, Cloud classic, Sea Pressure)<br><br>- Uses GPS Location to detect your location</div>"	"0.00"	"Weather"	"4"

We are a team of highly skilled people dedicated to working to give you the best.<br><br>There are two dominant influences on the climate in Kenya: the onshore monsoon winds from the Indian Ocean, and altitude. The winds determine the onset of Kenya’s two rainy seasons, with the hot northeast monsoon or kaskazi blowing dry air in from the Persian Gulf from November to March/April and the warm, moist kusi monsoon blowing in from the southeast from April/May to October. It’s the slightly cooler kusi that normally delivers the heaviest rain, a season known as the ‘long rains’, in late-April, May and early June. The relatively cool season, from late-June to October, gets much less rain. There’s a second rainy season, the ‘short rains’, for a few weeks in November and December, followed roughly from mid-December to March by a dry season of hot, usually rainless, weather.<br><br>Although prolonged rainfall isn’t that uncommon, the typical pattern is for rain to fall as a torrential downpour, lasting perhaps half an hour to an hour, with the sun then coming out and drying the wet ground in minutes. Camps and lodges always provide umbrellas, though your footwear will get muddy and you are still likely to get wet if you happen to be outside. There’s little point in bringing waterproofs.<br><br>The theory of Kenya’s climate is one thing: predicting the actual weather for specific dates is increasingly difficult as climate change impacts more and more, bringing floods and droughts, unseasonably cool and unseasonably hot weather. These impacts can be more than inconvenient: a dramatic flash flood swept the seasonally dry course of the Ewaso Nyiro in March 2010, destroying the bridge linking Samburu and Buffalo Springs national reserves and badly damaging several camps and lodges.

There is little rainfall. These generalizations should not, however, obscure the distinct differences existing among particular locations.

Woolen shawls are worn by women and men for warmth because few homes are heated. By mid-February the temperature begins to rise; springtime weather continues until mid-April, when the summer heat sets in. The onset of the southwest monsoon is anticipated to reach Punjab by May, but since the early 1970s the weather pattern has been irregular. The spring monsoon has either skipped over the area or has caused it to rain so hard that floods have resulted. June and July are oppressively hot. Although official estimates rarely place the temperature above 46° C, newspaper sources claim that it reaches 51° C and regularly carry reports about people who have succumbed to the heat. Heat records were broken in Multan in June 1993, when the mercury was reported to have risen to 54° C.

The Summer is mostly dry and sunny, sunshine may be nine hours a day, with local showers or thunderstorms in the afternoon and evening. As almost everywhere in Russia, winters can be very cold with frost and snowfall, the first Snow often falls in early October. Spring and Autumn can be quite unsettled, sometimes low pressure systems can bring frequent rain- or snowfall and strong winds. <br><br>Siberia: This area of Russia is famous for its extreme climate with very cold winters, but warm to hot summers, although they tend to be short and wet. Average Precipitation is about 500 mm, most falls in the form of rain in spring and Autumn. The winter is mostly dry, snow covers the ground from end october to mid march in some years. In the winter the weather can be very dangerous sometimes with temperatures below -35°C, strong winds and snowstorms. The coldest place in Russia is Oimjakon in the central Sibirian region Jakutia, where the winter temperatures are almost the lowest in the world, below -50°C im January.

This was a very successful part of our initial launch last hurricane season with over 40 video blogs delivered to the app from the landfall zone during hurricanes Isaac and Sandy.<br> <br>* We have developed our own tracking maps as well as specialized Tropical Cyclone Heat Potential tracking maps that not only plot the current and forecast positions of storms and hurricanes, but also give the user the added benefit of seeing the upper ocean heat content along the forecast path. Only Hurricane Impact has this feature! <br><br>* Our Twitter and Facebook updates are posted in the app for easy following of our social media interaction. URLs open just by tapping them from within the app - a nice feature to view pics as we post them. <br><br>* We also cover off-season weather such as winter storms, severe weather threats and more. <br><br>When hurricanes threaten land along the United States coastline, only Hurricane Impact will have live weather data feeding in to the app in real time.

This is the 2nd version /Update of the MobileApp where based on the feedback and public demand, following new features are added:<br>(1)	It has been made Multi-lingual. Languages are English, Hindi, Marathi and Gujarati –spoken in 4 SAFAR cities.<br>(2)	An excellent feature of Voice service is added which can be listened by clicking the speaker button.<br>(3)	The detailed advisory and precautions are added. To make it more attractive, an animated Flag boy is added who will change the color of flag based on the quality of air from Green to Maroon. The expression of boy will also change and Flag gets lifted up as Air Quality worsens.<br>Many of you raised an issue as to why this service is available in just 4 cities and not in other cities. I share your concern and deeply appreciate. However, expanding such services requires lot of financial resources and time. One SAFAR station requires minimum cost towards 10 AQMS, 10 AWS, super computer cost for forecast, emission inventory cost, outreach cost and so on. Depending on priority, projects are approved. We expect to expand it in future but not in near future as it stands.</div>"	"0.00"	"Weather"	"918"

"com.discipleskies.android.dsbarometer"	"DS Barometer - Altimeter and Weather Information"	"100000"	"3.9"	"<div jsname=""sngebd"">DS Barometer is a handsomely crafted barometer and air pressure recorder for Android devices with or without a barometric pressure sensor.  <br><br>Rapid changes in the barometric pressure usually precede significant changes in the weather.  Use the barometric pressure trends measured by this app with other atmospheric data (such as cloud patterns and temperature changes) to predict improving or worsening weather conditions.  <br><br>Barometric pressure monitoring can also be helpful for people with barometric migraine headache and other barometric-pressure related medical conditions, such as arthritis, that may be aggravated by changes in barometric pressure.  <br><br>The app includes a background pressure monitoring feature that was designed specifically for a mobile barometer unit.  Our pressure monitor is able to handle changes in location and altitude as you move about because all recorded pressures are reduced to sea level - that means that pressure trends and graphs can be interpreted without any concern that they were affected by a change in your elevation during the recording interval.  <br><br>For devices equipped with a barometer sensor, this application uses the atmospheric pressure measured by your phone to calculate the sea level adjusted barometric pressure at your location.  Temperature and altitude, also used in the calculation, are obtained by matching your position against weather and altitude survey databases.  These values are more reliable than the values returned from your GPS chip and your phone's temperature sensor and may result in a more meaningful barometric pressure reading.  <br><br>Additional Features:  <br><br>★ Tap on any of the dials and get a detailed explanation of how the displayed result was determined.<br><br>★ Easily control unit reporting for pressure, temperature and altitude by tapping on any meter.<br><br>★ Includes Altimeter supported by LIDAR and / or RADAR topographic surveys of your area.<br><br>★ Outdoor temperature reporting.<br><br>★ Includes free background atmospheric pressure monitoring with graphs and charts.<br><br>Devices without a barometric pressure sensor will show the barometric pressure at your location by using your GPS and internet connection.    <br><br>NOTE:  Some devices and some apps that offer a battery saving feature will turn off the monitoring features in this application.  If barometer monitoring is enabled and you are not able to record the pressure, you will need to turn off battery saving features.  <br>  <br>The app contains some advertising which is used to help offset the development costs.  If you cannot stand advertising and do not want to purchase the ad-removing feature, please do not download.  <br><br>★ ""DS Barometer.

The result is an accurate and stable weather forecast out to 30,60 and 90 days.  <br>This model is the Melita Weather Associates Long Range Weather Model. Melita’s model has taken nearly 20 years to perfect.  Over much of that time our forecasts were available only to utilities and hedge funds who made millions trading on the highly volatile energy markets.  Energy traders love our model because it often disagrees with the government model, and more often than not the Melita model correctly predicts the coming season.<br>Now the Melita model has been harnessed to give you the only free long range weather forecast in a mobile app.</div>"	"0.00"	"Weather"	"8"

Smog Light will automatically apply the knowledge in the analysis and give you clear results while dealing with all the caveats under the hood.<br><br>The results are presented in a simple, readable way requiring no smog-expertise to understand. For example: ""good"", ""bad"" or ""moderate"".<br><br>Smog Light uses data from measurement stations of the Chief Inspectorate Of Environmental Protection located within 10 km radius around you and covering up to 7 distinct types of air pollution, depending on the area.<br><br><br><b>Simplicity:</b><br><br>There is one setting - the threshold level of air quality triggering warning notifications.<br><br><br><b>Battery efficiency:</b><br><br>Smog Light exercises great care in using your phone's battery. Passive location method is used whenever possible. Air quality updates scheduling is properly delegated to the operating system, allowing to group similar requests together, thus saving power on radio wake-ups as well as the general device wake-ups.<br><br>Color-wise the app is optimized for AMOLED displays in order to further facilitate great battery life.<br><br>When smog notifications are turned off, the app never runs in the background, thus consuming no energy at all.<br><br><br><b>Security:</b><br><br>Smog Light is connecting directly to the official servers of the Chief Inspectorate Of Environmental Protection. Servers are authenticated and all of the communication is encrypted.<br><br><br><b>Technical details:</b><br><br>The app doesn't show you the raw data downloaded from the server, instead it performs the entire analysis itself based on it and only displays the end result. In order to analyse the data Smog Light combines the air quality measurement stations around you into a single virtual station by collecting individual pollutants' data from these stations as needed. The final verdict is the highest sub-index for an individual pollutant on the virtual station. <br><br>When any of the expected types of air pollution isn't covered, the app considers it a data shortage.

It’s like a real-feel allergy forecast for your allergies. <br><br>How ALLERGY IMPACT Works<br>Unlike static maps and figures, ALLERGY IMPACT analyzes weather information from 41,000 zip codes, search and social media trends to tell you how the pollen count may make you feel. It uses multiple factors to determine whether or not the pollen count could affect your allergies. If the ALLERGY IMPACT for the day is higher than the pollen count, you might feel allergy symptoms like sneezing and itchy eyes more than you’d expect. If it’s lower, your allergies might not feel as bad as the pollen count suggests that day.<br><br>Here’s how ZYRTEC® AllergyCast® with ALLERGY IMPACT can help you better manage your day:<br><br>• Daily ALLERGY IMPACT and pollen count to help you plan your day<br>• Hourly, 10-day weather, and allergy forecasts in one place<br>• Enhanced symptom tracking to help you learn what’s making you sneeze<br>• Multiple profiles to track your symptoms and those of loved ones.<br>• Customizable notifications alert you when pollen is high.<br>• Updates on how pollen is affecting other allergy sufferers in your area.</div>"	"0.00"	"Weather"	"2158"

Cilj projekta je takođe da za javnost obezbedi prikaz rezultata automatskog monitoringa kvaliteta vazduha, u realnom vremenu, iz državne i lokalnih mreža sa područja Vojvodine, Pančeva i Beograda. Pored Agencije, kao krajnjeg korisnika, u Projektu učestvuju Pokrajinski sekretarijat za urbanizam, graditeljstvo i zaštitu životne sredine, Novi Sad, Sekretarijat za zaštitu životne sredine Grada Pančeva i Gradski zavod za javno zdravlje Beograd. Projekat je realizovan kao distribuirani sistem sa centralnim serverom u Agenciji za zaštitu životne sredine i odgovarajućim vezama sa centrima postojećih lokalnih mreža u Novom Sadu, Pančevu i Beogradu. <br><br>Zakonska osnova Oblast kvaliteta vazduha u Republici Srbiji je uređena postojećom domaćom regulativom. Krovni zakon je Zakon o zaštiti vazduha („Sl. gl. RS” br. 36/09 i 10/13). Njegove odredbe, u oblasti monitoringa i ocene kvaliteta vazduha, preciziraju podzakonska akta: Uredba o uslovima za monitoring i zahtevima kvaliteta vazduha (“Sl. gl. RS” br.11/10 , 75/10 i 63/13), Uredba o utvrđivanju programa kontrole kvaliteta vazduha u državnoj mreži (“Sl. gl. RS” br. 58/11), Uredba o utvrđivanju zona i aglomeracija (“Sl. gl.

Agencija priprema i objavljuje Godišnji izveštaj o stanju kvaliteta vazduha u Republici Srbiji saglasno čl. 67 Zakon o zaštiti vazduha.<br><br>Uspostavljanje državnog sisitema za automatsko praćenje kvaliteta vazduha Agencija za zaštitu životne sredine je prve stanice za automatski monitoring kvaliteta vazduha postavila krajem 2006. godine u Smedervu i Boru. Zaključkom Vlade Republike od 30.08.2008 Agencija za zaštitu životne sredine je određena za odgovornog izvršioca poslova uspostavljanja i operativnog funkcionisanja sistema za automatski monitoring kvaliteta vazduha u Republici Srbiji. Glavni impuls uspostavljanju nacionalnog automatskog monitoringa kvaliteta vazduha u Republici Srbiji dao je CARDS projekat “SUPPLY OF EQUIPMENT FOR AIR QUALITY MONITORING”. Ovim EU projektom je donirana oprema za 28 mernih stanica, kalibracionu laboratoriju, analitičku laboratoruju, jedna mobilna stanica i jedno vozilo. Pripremne aktivnosti i veći deo projekta je realizovan u periodu 2008-2010, a okončan je 2011. Pored Agencije za zaštitu životne sredine ključnu podršku projektnim aktivnostima dao je Fond za zaštitu životne sredine. Fond je finansirao pripremu lokacija za postavljanje automatskih stanica, participirao u dogradnji laboratorije za kvalitet vazduha i finansirao nabavku opreme za postavljanje automatskih stanica na lokacijama od interesa a koje nisu bile obuhvaćene donacijom.

In addition to raw text, Sky MET provides you with:<br><br>- TAF and METAR decoding <br>- Crosswind component calculation<br>- Weather radar for each station <br>- Station NOTAMS <br>- And web cam images, allowing for a sneak peek at the station sky<br><br>Available after purchase of the pro version:<br><br>Wind Aloft<br>Quickly see what the winds will be like for any altitude between ground and FL 440<br><br>SIGMETs, AIRMETs and outlooks<br>Unlike most other weather apps, Sky MET presents you with the full range of international Sigmets and airmets required when preparing for your next trip, and when moving the time slider Sky MET will also provide a sigmet outlook.  Affected regions are drawn on the map along with the station summaries. You filter on any combination of:<br>- Sigmets<br>- Outlooks<br>- Tango Airmets<br>- Sierra Airmets<br>- ICE airmets<br><br>PIREPs<br>Use Sky MET to quickly see all PIREPs for the last hour. For your convenience the reports have been categorised in Turbulence, Icing and other PIREPs. Urgent pilot reports, for instance when reporting low level wind shear or heavy icing conditions, are clearly marked in red. <br><br>Clouds, ICE and tops<br>Sky MET calculates the areas with relatively high cloud density. These areas are displayed in on the map where blue and yellow coloration's indicate the likelihood of icing conditions. By sliding the altitude bar you can pick an altitude that is less affected by icing conditions. <br>A quick glance in the left hand top corner of the screen show you the forecasted ambient temperature, wind and relative humidity. The latter you determine weather or not clouds will be likely at that position and altitude. <br><br>Sat images and analysis.<br>Satellite images and significant weather charts are provided to complete the weather picture. <br><br>Good luck with Sky MET.

At camp, I sat in on a couple of Merit Badge sessions with the Scouts in the troop. One session was for the Programming Merit Badge (http://www.scouting.org/scoutsource/BoyScouts/AdvancementandAwards/MeritBadges/mb-PROG.aspx).<br><br>The Merit Badge counselors were going over JAVA programming with the Scouts that day. They were working on a very simple temperature conversion application (http://boyslife.org/about-scouts/merit-badge-resources/programming/42481/java/).  The Scouts were working on static variables, if statements, loops and input &amp; output. The counselors covered roughly three weeks of a college JAVA course in that session. The Scouts were captivated, excited to learn what they were being taught and were able to extrapolate, troubleshoot and improve the application during this session.<br><br>At the end of the session, the counselors said, “Your app is done.” To this, a Scout asked, “Can I run this on my phone?” The counselors said, “It isn’t that kind of app, this will only run on a PC.” <br><br>This prompted me to convert this simple application from Programming Merit Badge into this Android App.<br><br>UPDATE: We added a new graphic that highlights where the decimal point / negative sign button is located.  Both decimal &amp; negative decimal numbers can be converted.<br><br>This App is free and Ad Free.  Designed to run on an Android Phone.

"com.wdtinc.android.mwr"	"Weather Radio by WDT"	"10000"	"3.7"	"<div jsname=""sngebd"">Weather Radio (from the same company that brought your RadarScope) enables you to receive critical alerts via voice and push notification regarding life-threatening weather events. Your iPhone will “wake up” with alerts and also track your location to warn you wherever you go. Listen to local weather forecasts while you are on the move. Enjoy the power of a NOAA Weather Radio, with all the convenience and precision of a smart phone. <br><br>Weather Radio is an entirely revamped app, formerly known as iMap Weather Radio. WDT has made significant improvements to the app based on your reviews, feedback, and support inquiries. We appreciate your involvement! <br><br>***GENERAL FEATURES*** <br><br>•Patented Alerting Engine: Weather Radio provides more accurate alerts than those offered by typical consumer alerting services. Most of these services will alert you to severe weather if you are in a county only partially covered by a watch or warning, even if you are not actually directly within the watch/warning.  Weather Radio ensures you receive an alert only if your device or saved locations fall inside a watch/warning polygon. This means you are not disturbed by alarms irrelevant to your location. <br><br>•Complete Control: You control what types of alerts you receive through the app. From our extensive weather product list, choose only the type of alerts you want. For example, select only tornado warnings or just winter weather warnings for specific locations.<br><br>•Follow Me: Follow me is a critical feature if you are on the go. Imagine you are driving through an area of adverse weather. This app will alert you if you are in an area when a watch/warning is issued, without you having to do anything. <br><br>•Friends &amp; Family: Weather Radio can also save up to five fixed locations in addition to your current position. This means you can ensure friends and family at school, out of state, at a ballgame, etc., are safe. <br><br>•Audio: Weather Radio provides audio alerts in the form of beeps followed by a brief description of the alert type. The audio could wake you in the middle of the night, or give you information you need when you can’t stop to look at the phone. Furthermore, you can listen to the alerts and forecasts for your area at any time.<br><br>•Radar: Quickly reference where you are in relation to adverse weather utilizing the in-app radar system that features watch and warning overlay.<br><br>•Quick Forecast: Weather Radio is the only weather app you need. Quickly access current and forecast weather information for remote locations. Forecast features hourly data for up to three days in advance and daily information out to seven days.  <br><br>•Voice Over: We have optimized this app to work with Apple’s Voice Over technology ensuring our life-saving app is welcoming for the visually impaired.<br><br>•Video: In markets where local media partners participate, you can view streaming video of severe weather coverage for up-to-the-minute information. <br><br>***IN APP PURCHASES***<br><br>$4.99 – Lightning Alerting – WDT has harnessed the power of the ENTLN lightning network and combined it with our patented alerting engine. Lightning alerts are sent when a lightning strike is first detected within 6 miles of your location and an all clear is sent when no lightning is detected within that range for 30 minutes.  These are the rules recommended by lightning experts to ensure safety while outdoors. In addition to alerts, view real-time lightning strikes on the map.<br><br>***ABOUT WDT***<br>Weather Decision Technologies, Inc. is a weather content and technology partner for many major weather brands in the U.S. Weather is our business and weather safety is our passion. <br><br>***COMMUNITY*** <br>Learn more about Weather Radio and receive update notifications and information. <br>facebook.com/iMapWeatherRadio <br>twitter.com/Weather_Radio <br><br>***SUPPORT*** <br>Visit our support page for FAQs and questions. <br>http://support.wdtinc.com/mobile/Weather-Radio.html</div>"	"4.99"	"Weather"	"368"

The app provides current weather including temperature, relative humidity, rainfall, wind direction and speed, as well as weather photograph collected from nearby weather stations at user's location, specified location, or selected weather stations.  Weather photos and rainfall data will be updated at 5-minute and 15-minute intervals respectively.  Other data will be updated in 10-minute interval and the update time will be displayed at the bottom of the front page.<br><br>Points to note:<br><br>1. In the ""My Location Settings"", users can opt for using the automatic location service provided by the smartphone, or designating ""My Location"" on the map themselves.  This location will be displayed on the main page and in ""My Weather Report"". If your location cannot be found, ""My Location"" will show the last location which was successfully found or ""Hong Kong Observatory"". The meteorological data displayed on ""My Location"" or the station you added is provided by meteorological stations nearby, and is not necessarily from a station in the same region. In case meteorological data is not available from nearby stations, data from other meteorological stations at headquarter of the Observatory, King's Park, and Star Ferry will be used instead.  If this is the case, the symbol ▲ will appear to the left of the updated time.<br><br>2. The location displayed in the function of ""My Weather Report"" is provided by third party provider.<br><br>3. Depending on factors such as network usage and quality of user's mobile phone connection, it generally takes 5 to 15 minuntes for the app to receive the weather warning and Special Weather Tips after they are issued by the Hong Kong Observatory.<br><br>4. Although the “MyObservatory” is a free app, user will be charged by their mobile network service provider on the use of data service. These charges can become very expensive on roaming. Please ensure that the option of “Data Roaming” have been disabled in the settings of your mobile devices.  Meanwhile, the app requires user’s authorization on: “full network access”, “view network connections”, “view Wi-Fi connections” to download weather data over the Internet.<br><br>5. Owing to the difference in topography and altitude between the weather station and user's location, and also the error in the estimated position given by the mobile device, users should note that weather information displayed on the app may be different from actual conditions in using the ""MyObservatory"".<br><br>6. The clock on the main page of the app is synchronized automatically to the Observatory's Internet Time Server, and may not be the same as the time displayed on the smartphone.<br><br>7. Use of location-based rain forecast notification will increase the battery usage and data download.<br><br>8. To allow user to get hold to important weather information such as weather warning, Special Weather Tips, location-based rain forecast, etc., the “MyObservatory” would automatically notify users the above information according to user’s settings.  This feature requires user’s authorization on “run at startup”.<br><br>9. The app provides link for users to browse the Observatory's Facebook Page.  Users may choose to log in his/her own Facebook account.  More features of Facebook can be used after logging in.  Please be reminded to pay attention to the notes of the Facebook Page, and the privacy policies of the Facebook platform.<br><br>10. When isolated thunderstorms affect the territory and the Observatory issues a thunderstorm warning that mentions the affected regions, the thunderstorm warning icon on the main page of the app will be marked with a red dot. Upon clicking the icon, a map will be displayed to enable easy viewing of the regions affected by the thunderstorm warning.</div>"	"0.00"	"Weather"	"30693"

Niet alleen het risico dat je verbrandt; je kunt ook oververhit raken, uitdrogen of een hitteberoerte krijgen. Sommige mensen lopen door hun gezondheid ook meer risico dan anderen. Waar liggen de grenzen? En waar kun je zelf op letten? De hitte-index app van CNV Vakmensen geeft advies. <br><br>De hitte-index app meet hoe warm het is op de plek waar jij werkt. De app toont zowel de actuele temperatuur als de hitte index, de luchtvochtigheid en de zonkracht. De meting kun je doorsturen, bijvoorbeeld naar een collega. Je ziet in de app ook een overzicht van de temperaturen in het hele land. Push-notificaties waarschuwen je bij hoge temperaturen.<br><br>Wanneer is het te warm?<br><br>Er zijn geen wettelijke normen over wanneer het te warm is om te werken. Alleen de cao voor dakdekkers heeft hier afspraken over. Dat betekent dat je dus ook zelf moet opletten en zo nodig maatregelen moet nemen. De hitte-index app kan je hierbij helpen.<br><br>Hitte-index<br><br>De hitte-index app geeft aan welk risico je loopt. Hoe hoger de hitte-index, hoe hoger het risico. Het gaat hierbij niet alleen om de temperatuur, maar ook om de luchtvochtigheid. Bij een hogere luchtvochtigheid voelt een bepaalde temperatuur al snel minder prettig. De hitte-index wordt bepaald met de temperatuur in de schaduw. Als je in de volle zon werkt, kun je er 10 graden bij optellen.<br><br>Let ook op de zonkracht <br><br>De hitte-index zegt niets over de zonkracht. Houd er rekening mee dat de zon erg sterk kan zijn, ook op dagen dat het niet zo warm is. Op het midden van de dag is de zon op zijn sterkst. De hoogste temperatuur worden vaak pas in de tweede helft van de middag bereikt.</div>"	"0.00"	"Weather"	"3"

"nl.maris.seamobile"	"SeaMobile: Cyprus"	"1000"	"3.4"	"<div jsname=""sngebd"">The SeaMobile App provides a handy and dynamic guide to the beaches and marine waters of Cyprus. It gives for each beach local information (description and features), marine forecasts (waves, currents, temperature, salinity and winds) and weather forecasts. This is provided in tables and maps, including animations.<br><br>The information aims at users in the tourism and recreational sectors, in particular public visiting beaches, swimming, surfing, sailing, fishing, and diving, and professionals such as hotels, schools for diving, surfing, sailing, fishery trips organizers, boat rentals, and others.<br><br>The marine forecasts are updated daily with a forecast horizon of 3 days and include the sea currents, sea temperature and salinity, sea level, offshore significant wave height, swell, tides, as well as winds over the sea. These are derived from the operational coastal ocean forecasting and observing system (CYCOFOS) that is operated by the Oceanography Center of the University of Cyprus (OC-UCY). This Center conducts basic and applied research in the fields of ocean physics and dynamics, remote sensing, operational oceanography, and biological and chemical oceanography. It collects marine monitoring data by in-situ instruments and by satellites, which are used in CYCOFOS, and it cooperates with existing operational ocean forecasting networks in Europe. <br><br>The SeaMobile App has been developed by OC-UCY in cooperation with MARIS (Netherlands), WabbieWorks (Cyprus), and the Cyprus Tourism Organization (CTO). The App allows public to appreciate the power and changeability of the sea at many scales and in many aspects. The information services can also increase safety, because users will be warned of possible high waves or heavy currents and take these into account when planning their activities such as sailing, diving, boat trips and others. <br><br>The SeaMobile App adds flavour to the services that are already offered to tourists and make Cyprus even more attractive as a holiday destination. <br><br>The SeaMobile project is co-funded by the Repubic of Cyprus and the European Regional Development Fund. The SeaMobile information service is developed for giving tourist and recreational users access to customised marine data and forecasting services, adopting smart phones and mobile touch screen devices as distribution platforms.

Drones or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are most vulnerable to impact of geomagnetic storms.<br><br>By taking into account the forecast of geomagnetic storms, you can plan difficult decisions, avoid high physical stress, and protect yourself from negative consequences. <br><br>Our application will help you with this. <br><br>ABOUT THE NATURE OF THE GEOMAGNETIC STORMS <br><br>The Earth's geomagnetic field changes occur under the influence of the Sun. The intensity of the impact is not constant and depends on the ongoing processes on the solar surface. <br><br>The strength of geomatic field disturbances is characterized by the value of Kp index. The Kp index can be assigned values from 0 to 9, where 0 is the absence of disturbances and 9 represents extremely strong perturbations of the earth´s geomagnetic field. <br><br>Disturbances with a Kp index of 5 and above are called storms. <br><br>The number of geomagnetic storms per year can reach 50! <br><br>Available in Apple App Store<br>https://itunes.apple.com/app/id789651124<br><br>IN COMING UPDATES OF THE APPLICATION EXPECT <br><br>The ability to view history;<br>Personal forecasts.<br><br>* The app uses data of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.</div>"	"0.00"	"Weather"	"904"
