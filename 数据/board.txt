At the beginning of the game, each player's tokens are out of play and staged in one of the large corner areas of the board in the player's color (called the player's yard  ). When able to, the players will enter their tokens one per time on their respective starting squares, and proceed to race them clockwise around the board along the game track (the path of squares not part of any player's home column). When reaching the square below the home column, a player continues by racing tokens up the column to the finish square. The rolls of a cube die control the swiftness of the tokens, and entry to the finish square requires a precise roll from the player. The first to bring all their tokens to the finish wins the game. The others often continue play to determine second-, third-, and fourth-place finishers.<br><br>To enter a token into active play from his staging area to his starting square, a player must roll a 6. If the player has no tokens yet in play and does not roll a 6, the turn passes to the next player. Once a player has one or more tokens in play, he selects a token and moves it forward along the track the number of squares indicated by the die roll. If a player rolls a 6 he may choose to advance a token already in play, or alternatively, he may enter another of his tokens into active play. The rolling of a 6 earns the player an additional (""bonus"") roll in that turn. If the additional roll results in a 6 again, the player earns an additional bonus roll. If the third roll is also a 6, the player may not move a token and the turn immediately passes to the next player. Players must always move a token according to the die value rolled, and if no move is possible, pass their turn to the next. If the advance of a token finishes on a square occupied by an opponent's token, the opponent token is returned to its owner's yard. The returned token may only be reentered into play when the owner again rolls a 6.</div>"	"0.00"	"Board"	"1578"

If you make a mistake and wish to choose a different piece, tap on the piece you originally chose and it will release (it will not glow blue).<br><br>Alternatively, although you cannot drag or fling the pieces, you can sort of slide your finger from the attacking piece over to the capture piece and lift without highlighting either piece.<br><br>Here are the rules:<br>1) Each move must result in a capture. <br>2) There is no Check rule for the King.<br>3) To win the board, capture all but the last attacking piece.<br><br>Points are awarded depending on which piece you use to capture, and are assigned thusly:<br><br>Queen = 1 point<br>Rook = 2 points<br>King = 3 points<br>Bishop = 4 points<br>Knight = 5 points<br>Pawn = 6 points<br><br>For example, if you capture another piece with the Knight you are awarded 5 points.<br><br>Boards will usually have more than one solution. However, your goal is to try to solve the board with the most points for that scenario. Boards are not just randomly generated or preset, but go through a complex algorithm to generate a solvable scenario.<br><br>If you get stuck on a board, you may request another configuration by selecting Number Of Pieces and choosing your desired board. You may adjust the volume either On or Off. You may also toggle among different Chess board backgrounds by holding the Help button.<br><br>One approach to these Chess brain game puzzles is to initially solve the board any way you can without regard to score. This will give you a goal upon which to improve. After subsequent retries you will oftentimes find other solutions which result in higher scores, even if only by 1 or 2 points but sometimes as much as 8 or 10 points. You may retry a board as many times as you wish.</div>"	"1.99"	"Board"	"10"

Find out why millions of people have played this classic board game for over 50 years!<br><br>Yahtzee is a dice game, which was first marketed as ""Yatzie"" in the early 1940s. <br>Yatzie was included in a game set called ""LUCK - 15 Grand Dice Games"".<br><br>The object of the game is to score points by rolling five dice to make certain combinations. The dice can be rolled up to three times in a turn to try to make various scoring combinations. A game consists of thirteen rounds. After each round the player chooses which scoring category is to be used for that round. <br><br>Once a category has been used in the game, it cannot be used again. The scoring categories have varying point values, some of which are fixed values and others where the score depends on the value of the dice. A Yahtzee is five-of-a-kind and scores 50 points; the highest of any category. The winner is the player who scores the most points.<br><br>The Yahtzee scorecard contains 13 different category boxes and in each round, after the third roll, the player must choose one of these categories. The score entered in the box depends on how well the five dice match the scoring rule for the category. Details of the scoring rules for each category are given below. As an example, one of the categories is called Three of a Kind. The scoring rule for this category means that a player only scores if at least three of the five dice are the same value. The game is completed after 13 rounds by each player, with each of the 13 boxes filled. The total score is calculated by summing all thirteen boxes, together with any bonuses.<br><br>The Yahtzee scorecard contains 13 scoring boxes divided between two sections:<br>- Upper section <br>- Lower section<br><br>A Yahtzee is a 5 of a Kind (i.e. all the die faces are the same), and it scores 50 points. If you roll more than one Yahtzee in a single game, you will earn a 100 point bonus for each additional Yahtzee roll, provided that you have already scored a 50 in the Yahtzee category. If you have not scored in the Yahtzee category, you will not receive a bonus. If you have scored a zero in the Yahtzee category, you cannot receive any bonuses during the current game.<br><br>Play the Classic Yahtzee, against a series of increasingly challenging opponents.<br><br>Play with your Facebook friends, against the computer in Offline mode, against your friends in Play with Friends Mode or with millions of Yahtzee players around the world in Online Mode.<br><br>You can also create Private Rooms and invite your friends to play.<br><br>Unlock different Rooms and Levels by earning more Coins and XP and you can also Challenge your opponent for a rematch.

Although we notice the gathering more and more in the village, we are also observing the attraction among the city dwellers or urban people. <br><br>The equipments of this game are easily available. Generally the board of this game is made by drawing some particular lines or tables on the plain land and we choose pieces of dry branch or small pieces of brick or pieces of bamboo or cane as a pawn (guti). Two players take their seat at the opposite direction of the board. <br><br>How To Play: <br>This game begins between two players and there is 32 guti's altogether of which everyone possesses 16 beads. Two players place their sixteen beads from the edge of the board. As a result the middle line remains empty so that the players can make their move in the free spaces. It's decided before who will make the first move to play. <br>After the beginning of the game, the players can move their beads one step forward, backward, right, and left and diagonally where there is an empty space. Each player tries to seize opponent’s beads. If a player can cross a pawn of the other player, than that pawn will be deducted or under your capture. Thus that player will be winner who can capture all the pawns of his opponent first. <br><br><br>About This App:<br>We have made a digital version of Sholo Guti game with a fresh form to represent before you which is the holder and bearer of our old tradition from time immemorial.

For example: if i place a bet of 10 rupees on ""Burja"" and two of the dices show ""Burja"" when the bucket is lifted then i get 20 rupees from the host plus the original 10 rupees also.<br><br>So either you can become a host and take others money or place the bets and get lucky.

CPU* hará caso de la IA en un 50% de las veces y CPU** en un 75%. Si no, mirará la siguiente situación y volverá a plantearse si hace caso o no. Es decir, la inteligencia de la CPU se establece en función de si hace más o menos caso de la IA, no de si debe sacar un valor de dado determinado.<br><br>★ <b>La CPU saca los números que necesita para matar.</b><br>La IA intenta mover las fichas de forma que tenga más posibilidades de matar a los enemigos y/o que esté menos amenazada por ellos.<br>Activando la opción Cheat se pueden ver los dados que serán lanzados en los siguientes turnos. La CPU no puede sacar los dados adecuados para matar puesto que no sabe qué ficha vamos a mover.<br><br>★ <b>La CPU siempre mata si estamos a tiro.</b><br>Se puede ver que no es cierto en las estadísticas. En la pantalla ""Probabilidades comer fichas"", los porcentajes de la derecha nos dicen cuántas veces de las que un jugador/CPU ha tenido a alguien a tiro, ha matado. Si fuera cierto, ese porcentaje sería del 100%.<br><br>★ <b>Los dados no son aleatorios. Al cargar una partida se repiten los lanzamientos.</b><br>Internamente se lanzan los dados para los 5 turnos siguientes por si activamos la opción Cheat y deben ser mostrados. Se guardan al grabar o minimizar el juego, de forma que al cargar una partida los 5 lanzamientos siguientes se repiten. No es que los lanzamientos se establezcan a priori para favorecer a la máquina.<br><br>★ <b>Pese a todo sigo pensando que hace trampas.</b><br>Utiliza la opción ""Cheat: utilizar series de dados preestablecidas"".

They invite attempts at a solution that range from trial and error to extensive mathematical analysis. <br><br>These puzzles are frequently used in job interviews. They are also taught to children in schools along with chess to boost their IQs and improve their critical thinking, mathematical problem-solving, and strategy development.<br><br>Your goal in every level is to move all of the characters across the river while observing certain rules and restrictions. Once you have completed a level, you will receive one star for level completion. You can obtain an additional star if you finish the level in the minimum number of moves, and another if you finish the level in a set time that varies from level to level.<br><br>Try your best, work as quickly as you can, and keep your number of moves low to earn more stars. Your total number of stars will help you access more advanced levels.<br><br>If you like playing chess and solving logic puzzles, then you are all set for new challenges.

To enter a token into play from its yard to its starting square, a player must roll a 6. If the player has no tokens yet in play and rolls other than a 6, the turn passes to the next player. Once a player has one or more tokens in play, he selects a token and moves it forwards along the track the number of squares indicated by the dice. Players must always move a token according to the dice value rolled. Passes are not allowed. If no move is possible, the turn moves to the next player.<br><br>When a 6 is rolled, the player may choose to advance a token already in play, or may enter another staged token to its starting square. Rolling a 6 earns the player an additional or ""bonus"" roll in that turn. If the bonus roll results in a 6 again, the player earns an additional bonus roll. If the third roll of Ludo Star is also a 6, the player may not move and the turn immediately passes to the next player.<br><br>If the advance of a token ends on a square occupied by an opponent's token, the opponent token is returned to its owner's yard. The returned token can be reentered into play only when the owner rolls a 6. There are no ""safe"" squares on the game track which protect a player's tokens from being returned. A player's home column squares are always safe, however, since no opponent may enter them.<br><br>Play this awesome game of Royal, Ludo Star, Queens and Kings.

These lines are different in length according to the sides of the hexagonal shape. Each player is allowed to shade only one piece. The basic idea is to precede the shading of the last piece in the horizontal line or the diagonal line to the right or left. For example, When the player shuts the last pieces of a horizontal line consisting of 5 pieces added to the score 5 points or When The last of the slash consists of 4 pieces added to the score 4 points and so until all the shading of the pieces and the player is the winner is the highest player score<br><br>- Supports play with Android device<br>- Supports play with Friend close to you<br>- Supports play via Bluetooth connection<br>- Supports two language English and Arabic</div>"	"0.00"	"Board"	"17"

Concentration and luck are the only weapons you'll have at your disposal! You'll need to fully master mind and body to defeat your opponents.<br><br>THINK STRATEGY! <br>Every opponent has four warriors and one elder at their disposal. The objective is simple: win the battle. To do so, you must either capture your opponent's elder or take their place in the temple arch. The game is easy to play, but you'll need time to become a true master. Although, not really... Onitama is the ideal strategy game for exercising your mind, as you'll have to think ahead about moves! The moves you're allowed to make are determined by five cards which are drawn at random, shown face-up, and shared between players. Each card corresponds to an animal and sets out a specific move that you have to follow. When you play a card, you must place it between you and your opponent and pick up the previously played card, and so on. This way, both players have the exact same chance of winning the game.<br><br>IT'S ALL ABOUT ANALYSIS… <br>The key to success in this simple, elegant type of combat is to stay calm and concentrate. The Shrine of Onitama is a sacred ground where foresight is necessary. Animal spirits will guide you on the perilous path and allow you to gain true wisdom.

Combine wisely your characters and actions' cards to obtain the most power! You attempt to have the most power on the Base from your minions when the Base is smashed. Sounds easy?<br><br>How easy is it when an opponent's Alien-Ninja decides to Beam Up your minions to other Bases - flat out Assassinate them? What about when the Pirate-Dinosaur player Full Sails in and releases King Rex to stomp your minions into the ground, or when the Wizard-Zombies use their Mystic Power to create an Outbreak, suddenly flooding minions onto the Base from the discard pile? Or what if you faced a Zombie-Dinosaur player instead and he created an Outbreak of massive beasts all at once?!?<br><br>SCORE THE 15 NECESSARY POINTS &amp; WIN THE GAME!<br><br>When a Base is smashed, each player in first, second and third place scores points. Fourth place? Sorry, bro – try harder next time.<br>With nine different factions, Smash Up includes dozens of combinations to try. Pirate-Aliens play different than Ninja-Aliens, for instance. Which will you use to smash up your opponents?<br>And did we mention the dinosaurs have laser beams?<br><br>FEATURES<br><br>- Online Cross-platform multiplayer: 2 to 4 players<br>- Play with 4 players or solo against the AI<br>- 9 faction decks, including the base game set and more: Zombies, Aliens, Dinosaurs, Ninjas, Pirates, Robots, Tricksters, Wizards &amp; Geeks<br>- Random or manual faction selection<br>- Fully automated scoring<br>- Tutorial system plus ‘Step Through’ and ‘Review' modes to help players learn<br>- Leader boards &amp; Achievements<br>- Contains 16 Base cards to compete over<br><br>To find more information about Asmodee Digital, please go to: http://www.asmodee-digital.com/<br><br>Having an issue?

It is  one of the oldest games in the world, dating back thousands of years. In Botswana (Southern Africa), Morabaraba was considered as a sport for women but the game has also contributed immensely in basic mathematics for primary schools and informal education. The game consists of holes carved on the ground with stones which are used in the game play. This is the electronic version and consists of holes carved on a wooden block and pebbles used to play the game.<br><br>HOW TO PLAY:<br>Morabaraba consists of two sets of 12 holes and 36 small stones. Each player moves the stones in their set of holes in a clockwise direction and collects them into one accumulation hole (Jelo). <br><br>The player who manages to accumulate all their stones first is the winner. <br>1. To begin, each hole starts off with three stones.             <br>2. The two players then decide who will play first.<br>3. The first player chooses and marks their collection point.           <br>4. The other player does likewise. <br>5. The first player then picks stones from any hole, except the collection point, and starts distributing them one stone into each hole in a clockwise direction.<br>6. If the last stone goes into a hole that has stones in it, and is not the accumulation hole, the player picks all the stones in that hole and continues.<br>7. If the last stone goes into the accumulation hole, the player can continue by picking stones from any hole but not the collection point<br>8.

It allows players to scan ingredient cards from the board game to find out what potions they can create.<br><br>---<br><br>In Alchemists, two to four budding alchemists compete to discover the secrets of their mystical art. Points can be earned in various ways, but most points are earned by publishing theories – correct theories, that is — and therein lies the problem.<br><br>The game is played in six rounds. At the beginning of the round, players choose their play order. Those who choose to play later get more rewards.<br>Players declare all their actions by placing cubes on the various action spaces, then each action space is evaluated in order. Players gain knowledge by mixing ingredients and testing the results using a smartphone app (iOS, Android, and also Windows) that randomizes the rules of alchemy for each new game. And if the alchemists are longing for something even more special, they can always buy magical artifacts to get an extra push. There are 9 of them (different for each game) and they are not only very powerful, but also very expensive. But money means nothing, when there's academic pride at stake! And the possession of these artifacts will definitely earn you some reputation too. Players can also earn money by selling potions of questionable quality to adventurers, but money is just a means to an end. The alchemists don't want riches, after all. They want respect, and respect usually comes from publishing theories.<br><br>During play, players' reputations will go up and down. After six rounds and a final exhibition, reputation will be converted into points. Points will also be scored for artifacts and grants. Then the secrets of alchemy are revealed and players score points or lose points based on whether their theories were correct.

"com.checkersgame.board"	"Checkers Glow"	"100"	"0"	"<div jsname=""sngebd""><b>Draughts (British English) or checkers (American English) is a group of strategy board games for two players which involve diagonal moves of uniform game pieces and mandatory captures by jumping over opponent pieces. Draughts developed from alquerque. The name derives from the verb to draw or to move.</b><br><br>The most popular forms are English draughts, also called American checkers, played on an 8×8 checkerboard; Russian draughts, also played on an 8×8, and international draughts, played on a 10×10 board. There are many other variants played on 8×8 boards. Canadian checkers and Singaporean/Malaysian checkers (also locally known as dum) are played on a 12×12 board.<br><br><b>General rules</b><br>Draughts is played by two opponents, on opposite sides of the gameboard. One player has the dark pieces; the other has the light pieces. Players alternate turns. A player may not move an opponent's piece. A move consists of moving a piece diagonally to an adjacent unoccupied square. If the adjacent square contains an opponent's piece, and the square immediately beyond it is vacant, the piece may be captured (and removed from the game) by jumping over it.<br><br>Only the dark squares of the checkered board are used. A piece may move only diagonally into an unoccupied square. Capturing is mandatory in most official rules, although some rule variations make capturing optional when presented. In almost all variants, the player without pieces remaining, or who cannot move due to being blocked, loses the game.<br><br><b>Kings </b><br>When a man reaches the kings row (also called crownhead, the farthest row forward), it becomes a king, and is marked by placing an additional piece on top of the first man, and acquires additional powers including the ability to move backwards and (in variants where they cannot already do so) capture backwards. Like men, a king can make successive jumps in a single turn provided that each jump captures an enemy man or king.<br><br>In <b>international draughts</b>, kings (also called flying kings) move any distance along unblocked diagonals, and may capture an opposing man any distance away by jumping to any of the unoccupied squares immediately beyond it. Since jumped pieces remain on the board until the turn is complete, it is possible to reach a position in a multi-jump move where the flying king is blocked from capturing further by a piece already jumped.<br><br><b>Flying kings</b> are not used in English draughts; a king's only advantage over a man is the ability to move and capture backwards as well as forwards.<br><br><b>Checkers Game Strategy</b><br>- Always diagonally double up your checkers so they cannot be jumped.<br>- Get your checkers kinged as soon as possible, as this will allow them to move freely around the board.<br>- Select a two person Checkers game to play with a friend or family!<br><br>keywords : Pool checkers, draughts, English draughts, World Checkers, Checkers King, Royal Checkers</div>"	"0.00"	"Board"	"0"

Запрещается произносить слова (любые, даже «да», «нет» и т. п.) и звуки, особенно те, по которым легко угадать слово (например: по «му» можно легко догадаться, что загадана корова). Запрещается губами проговаривать слова. Желательно (на усмотрения игроков) не указывать на окружающие вас предметы, оказывающие на загаданное слово. Для показа слова или группы слов (в зависимости от конкурса) отведено определенное время. Если правильный ответ не прозвучал до окончания этого срока, то слово считается не угаданным. Внимание!

Нельзя во время объяснения использовать однокоренные слова, озвучивать перевод с иностранных языков, явно показывать жестами. Отгаданные слова приносит команде одно очко, а за пропущенное слово команда штрафуется (в зависимости от настроек).

Stockpile centers on the idea that nobody knows everything about the stock market, but everyone does know something. In the game, this philosophy manifests in two ways: insider information and the stockpile.<br><br>Both of these mechanisms are combined with some stock market elements to make players consider multiple factors when selling a stock. Do you hold onto a stock in hopes of catching a lucrative stock split or do you sell now to avoid the potential company bankruptcy? Can you hold onto your stock until the end of the game to become the majority shareholder, or do you need the liquidity now for future bidding? Do you risk it all by investing heavily into one company, or do you mitigate your risk by diversifying your portfolio?<br><br>In the end, everyone knows something about the stock market, so it all comes down to strategy execution. Will you be able to navigate the movements of the stock market with certainty? Or will your investments go under from poor predictions?<br><br>Stockpile: Continuing Corruption<br>--------------------------------------------------------<br>The first expansion for Stockpile contains four expansion modules that can be played separately or used all together for more strategic game play.<br><br>Module 1: Forecast Dice — Six custom dice offer more excitement by changing the market forecast round-to-round. Roll the dice at the beginning of the round. The dice cause the market to rise or fall on any given turn and ensures that no two games will ever be the same.<br><br>Module 2: Bonds — Bond present a new, safe investment option for players. Purchasing bonds can provide a steady stream of interest payments every round. However, it comes at a price. The original money used to purchase bonds cannot be recovered until the end of the game. Be careful not to overspend or you might lose out on valuable stockpiles.<br><br>Module 3: Commodities &amp; Taxes — Commodities &amp; Taxes create much more tension during the game. Each round, players add Commodities or Taxes to the stockpiles. Collect different types of commodities and dodge taxes to earn substantial end-game bonuses.<br><br>Module 4: More Investors — Stockpile: Continuing Corruption adds six new investors from around the world who have heard about massive profits being made, and they want in on the action. Each investor possesses a unique ability that opens up more ways to win.<br><br>The addon is included for free in the base game.<br><br>Features<br>--------------------------------------------------------<br>- The easy to follow tutorial guides you through the rules<br>- cross-platform play with all opponents<br>- ranked and casual games<br>- world ladder with GLICKO rating<br>- 6 optional combinable rulesets for unlimited replayability<br>- 3 AI opponents (easy, medium and hard)<br>- scalable game complexity<br>- play offline alone or with your friends/spouse<br>- asynchronous game with notifications<br>- fast ranked games for live experience<br>- 10 new quality avatars for your DIGIDICED collection<br>- Languages: English, German, French, Spanish, Korean, Chinese (simplified), Japanese, Russian and Italian<br><br>Awards of the physical game<br>--------------------------------------------------------<br>2015 Cardboard Republic Socializer Laurel Nominee</div>"	"4.99"	"Board"	"70"

"com.ekraft.ludogame"	"Ludo Game"	"500000"	"4.1"	"<div jsname=""sngebd"">Pachisi or ludo originated in India by the 6th century. The earliest<br>evidence of this game in India is the depiction of boards on the caves<br>of Ajanta.<br><br>This game was played by the Mughal emperors of India; and kings of<br>India. It is said that the Mysore Ruler Customized the game to 6<br>Players so he could play with his 5 queens together.<br><br>Variations of the game made it to England during the late 19th<br>century. One which appeared around 1896 under the name of Ludo.<br><br>The players alternate turns in a clockwise direction.To enter a token<br>into play from its staging area to its starting square, a player must<br>roll a 6. If the player has no tokens yet in play and does not roll a<br>6, the turn passes to the next player. Once a player has one or more<br>tokens in play, he selects a token and moves it forward along the<br>track the number of squares indicated by the die roll. Players must<br>always move a token according to the die value rolled, and if no move<br>is possible, pass their turn to the next player.<br><br>When a player rolls a 6 he may choose to advance a token already in<br>play, or alternatively, he may enter another staged token to its<br>starting square. The rolling of a 6 earns the player an additional<br>(""bonus"") roll in that turn. If the additional roll results in a 6<br>again, the player earns an additional bonus roll. If the third roll is<br>also a 6, the player may not move a token and the turn immediately<br>passes to the next player.<br><br>A player may not end his move on a square he already occupies. If the<br>advance of a token ends on a square occupied by an opponent's token,<br>the opponent token is returned to its owner's yard. The returned token<br>may only be reentered into play when the owner again rolls a 6.<br>(Unlike Pachisi, there are no ""safe"" squares on the game track which<br>protect a player's tokens from being returned. A player's home column<br>squares are always safe, however, since no opponent may enter them.<br>Ludo played in the Indian subcontinent features a safe square in each<br>quadrant, normally the fourth square from the top in the rightmost<br>column. These squares are usually marked with a star.<br><br>The Player whoes all four tokens reach Home Wins!</div>"	"0.00"	"Board"	"1715"

The wonderful Kickstarter community of both superbackers and newcomers from 23 different countries are the humans who willingly poured some serious dose of opportunity in our glass and then raised it to the point of celebration! Thanks to them, the project became a reality. :)<br><br>Drinkagon is a board game for up to 8 players, that combines drinking and strategic thinking. Drinkagon's set-up takes a few sips worth of time and, just like your favorite shot, the rules are kept short and sweet. You have to carefully plan your moves and find the shortest possible way to conquer your opponent’s base with your figurines. Players need to use tactics so they don’t step on the green (Truth) or red (Dare) fields - in order to stay sober. Their strategic skills and ability to stay sharp are put on test once they get tipsy. While playing, you can always skip drinking by simply consenting to reveal your secrets and getting awkwardly embarrassed in front of the other players.<br><br>For spicing up the tactical part of the game and to add some chaos into the pot of logic, our Drinkagon App brings to life the virtual cards that condition the opponents to either perform a challenge, answer a personal question or drink a specific dosage of their favourite potion. You can use it to roll a unique virtual dice or to draw one of hundreds truth&amp;dare cards. We’re going to keep on injecting new cards, sorting them into new themes and adding other functionalities to make Drinkagon interesting and fun no matter how many rounds you end up playing.<br><br>FEATURES:<br><br>* Regular, Sport &amp; NSFW themes of card decks<br>* Decks of over 800 truth &amp; dare challenges, plus a virtual D12 dice<br>* Free to download &amp; use anytime, globally - no ads or banners of any kind<br>* A network connection is not required to use the app<br>* Continuously open for updates, we expect the app to improve the game flow along with delivering a great dose of fun since there is no limit to a diversity of cards players can draw<br>* New updates are planned with more cards and special features, so stay tuned! :)<br><br>We’ve poured a lot of joy into design&amp;creation, and hopefully it will bring a ton of good vibes to you.

Like other cross and circle games, Ludo is derive from the Indian game Pachisi, but simpler. The game and its variations are popular in many countries and under various names.<br><br>Each player rolls the dice. To enter a token into play from its yard to its starting square, a player must roll a 6. If the player has no tokens yet in play and rolls other than a 6, the turn passes to the next player. Once a player has one or more tokens in play, he selects a token and moves it forwards along the track the number of squares indicated by the dice. Players must always move a token according to the dice value rolled. Passes are not allowed. If no move is possible, the turn moves to the next player.<br><br>When a 6 is rolled, the player may choose to advance a token already in play, or may enter another staged token to its starting square. Rolling a 6 earns the player an additional or ""bonus"" roll in that turn. If the bonus roll results in a 6 again, the player earns an additional bonus roll. If the third roll is also a 6, the player may not move and the turn immediately passes to the next player.<br><br>If the advance of a token ends on a square occupied by an opponent's token, the opponent token is returned to its owner's yard. The returned token can be reentered into play only when the owner rolls a 6. There are no ""safe"" squares on the game track which protect a player's tokens from being returned. A player's home column squares are always safe, however, since no opponent may enter them.<br><br>Play this awesome game of Royal, Queens and Kings.

More numbers are better.<br>Please, decide a person who will play a moderator role.<br>All the rest players sit in a circle.<br>The moderator decides a number of players and roles on the werewolf application.<br>There should be at least two “Werewolf” players and one “Seer” All the rest “Villager”.<br>Push the start button and give the app to the first player.<br>The player should put his name and check his role, but must keep it secret.<br>The next player does the same way as previous player.<br>If they have done it all and then give the app back to the moderator.<br>Two players are now secretly werewolves. They are trying to slaughter everyone in the village. <br>* The number of werewolves can be grown as the number of players<br><br>- The Game: Night and Day<br><br>The game proceeds in alternating night and day phases. We begin with Night.<br>At Night, the moderator tells all the players ""Close your eyes."" Everyone should.<br>The moderator says ""Werewolves, open your eyes."" The two werewolves do so, and look around to recognize each other.<br>The moderator says ""Werewolves, pick someone to kill."" The two werewolves silently agree on one villager to kill. (It is critical that they remain silent. The other players are sitting there with their eyes closed, and the werewolves don't want to give themselves away. Sign language is appropriate, or just pointing, nodding, raising eyebrows, and so on.)<br>When the werewolves have agreed on a victim, and the moderator understands who they picked, the moderator says ""Werewolves, close your eyes.""<br>The moderator says ""Seer, open your eyes. Seer, pick someone to ask about."" The seer opens his eyes and silently points at another player. (Again, it is critical that this be entirely silent -- because the seer doesn't want to reveal his identity to the werewolves.)<br>The moderator silently signs thumbs-up if the seer pointed at a werewolf, and thumbs-down if the seer pointed at an innocent villager. The moderator then says ""Seer, close your eyes.""<br>The moderator says ""Everybody open your eyes; it's daytime. And you have been torn apart by werewolves."" He indicates the person that the werewolves chose. That person is immediately dead and out of the game. He reveals his card, showing what he was, and leaves it face-up.<br>Now it is Day. Daytime is very simple; all the living players gather in the village and lynch somebody. The mob wants bloody justice.<br>As soon as a majority of players vote for a particular player to die, the moderator says ""Ok, you're dead."" That player then reveals his card, and the rest of the players find out whether they've lynched a human, a werewolf, or the seer.<br>There are no restrictions on speech. Any living player can say anything he wants -- truth, misdirection, nonsense, or lie.<br>Contrariwise, dead players may not speak at all. As soon as the sun comes up and the moderator indicates that someone is dead, he may not speak for the rest of the game. No dying soliloquies allowed. Similarly, as soon as a majority vote indicates that a player has been lynched, he is dead. If he wants to protest his innocence or reveal some information (like the seer's visions), he has to do it before the vote goes through.<br>No player may reveal his card, to anyone, even when he is killed. All you can do is talk.<br>Once a player is lynched, night falls immediately and the cycle repeats. Everyone closes their eyes, the werewolves (or werewolf) secretly select someone to kill, the seer (if alive) secretly learns another player's status; then the sun rises, one player is found dead, and the remaining players begin to discuss another lynching. Repeat until one side wins.<br><br>* Please see our website or a manual in the application for more details.</div>"	"0.99"	"Board"	"0"

Bu oyunda amaç mümkün olduğu kadar az puanla oyunu bitirmektir. Tüm turlar sonunda en az puana sahip olan oyuncu oyunun galibidir. Puanlar elde kalan taşların üzerindeki sayılar ile belirlenir (örnek: bir kırmızı 3 = üç puan, bir siyah 11 = 11 puan) Oyun desteden çekecek taş kalmayınca bitebileceği gibi oyunculardan birinin elini tamamlaması ile de bitebilir. Oyun belli sayıda turlardan oluşur (örnek: 3, 5, 7, 9 veya 11 tur). Her tur oyunculardan birinin elini bitirmesine kadar sürer.<br><br>Oyuncular arasından bir oyuncunun dağıtıcı olarak belirlenmesinden sonra dağıtıcı her oyuncuya 21 taş dağıtır ve kendine 22 taş alır. Geri kalan taşlar masada ters çevrilmiş şekilde dururken bir tane taş açık durur. Bu açık taş jokeri (OKEY taşını) belirler. Oyun saat yönünün tersine doğru oynanır. Oyuna taş dağıtan başlar ve bu oyuncu taş çekmeden bir taş atar. Sonra onun sağındaki oynar. Her sırası gelen oyuncu ya desteden bir taş çeker ya da bir önceki oyuncunun attığı son taşı alır. Oyuncu taş çektikten sonra eğer elindeki serilerin toplamı 101 sayısına ulaşıyorsa elini açabilir (dizdiği serileri masanın üstüne koyar). Oyuncu elini açınca elindeki serileri masaya diğer seri taşların yanına koyar. Eğer oyuncu masaya taş açamıyorsa masaya bir taş atarak sırasını savar. Oyun sırası gelen oyuncu sırasını mutlaka masaya bir taş atarak tamamlar hatta tüm elini açsa dahi son taşını masaya atmak zorundadır.<br><br>El açmak için en az 101 sayınız olmalıdır. El açmak için elinizde aynı numaralı değişik renklerden 3 veya 4 adet set (örnek olarak siyah 5, kırmızı 5 ve bir tane de mavi 5) veya aynı renklerden sıralı sayı seti (örnek olarak kırmızı 7,8,9) olmalıdır. Bir sette minimum 3 taş olmalıdır. Mevcut açılmış taşlara taş eklenebilmesi için oyuncunun minimum 101 sayısına ulaşarak elini açmış gerekir. Aynı oyun sırasında hem elinizi açabilir hem de diğer açılmış setlere eklemeler yapabilirsiniz. Eğer oyuncu kendinden önceki oyuncunun attığı taşı alırsa bu aldığı taşı kullanmak zorundadır. Eğer bu atılan taşı alan oyuncu henüz elini açmamış ise bu taşı aldığı zaman elini açmalı ve açtığı setlerin birinin içinde bu alınan taş da kullanılmış olmalıdır. Bu alınan taşın elinizde istekada durmasına müsaade edilmez. Eğer bu alınan taş set oluşturmada veya el açmada kullanılamıyorsa bu taş geri yerine konur ve desteden bir taş çekilir. Bu yanlışlıktan dolayı ceza puanı verilmez.<br><br>Eli açmak için bir başka yol da en az beş çift taş biriktirmektir. Çiftten anlaşılan benzer iki taştır. Eğer oyuncu bir kez çifte giderek oyun açarsa bu oyunda bir daha normal bir set açamaz. Ancak diğer oyuncuların açmış oldukları masadaki setlere taş ekleyebilir. Eğer masadaki dört oyuncu da aynı oyun içinde çift açarsa bu tur iptal olur ve yeni oyuna başlanır. Hiçbir oyuncu bu oyunda ceza puanı almaz.<br><br>Ayrıca Pişti, Batak, Okey, Hearts, Spades, Gin Rummy gibi oyunlarımızı da deneyebilirisiniz.<br>101 Okey hd ekranlara sahiptir.<br><br>101, 101 okey, okey 101, 101 oyna, 101 indir, 101 okey hd, 101 okey oyna, 101 okey indir, internetsiz 101, 101 internetsiz, 101 plus, yüzbir okey, yüzbir oyna, okey yüzbir, yüzbir indir, 101 okey plus, yüzbir okey oyna, 101 online, online 101, çanak 101, çanak 101 okey, 101 okey online, okey, okey indir, okey plus, online okey, okey oyun, okey hd, okey oyna, okey oyunu, yüzbir, yüzbir okey indir, batak hd, okey oyun, yüzbir okey plus, bedava okey, okey pro, online okey, gamyun, yuzbir, yuzbir oyna, 101 okey pro, mynet okey, mynet 101, mynet 101 okey.</div>"	"0.00"	"Board"	"9847"

The back rows are vacant. A traditional gameboard is mono-coloured. White moves first.<br><br>Men move orthogonally forwards or sideways one square, capturing by means of a jump; they cannot move or capture backwards or diagonally. When a man reaches the back row, it promotes to a king. Kings can move any number of empty squares orthogonally forwards, backwards or sideways. A king captures by jumping over a single piece any number of empty squares away, landing on any open square beyond the captured piece along a straight line.<br><br>Pieces are removed from the board immediately after being jumped. If a jump is available it must be taken. If there is more than one way to jump, the one capturing the most number of pieces must be taken. There is no distinction between king and man during captures; each counts as a piece. If there is more than one way to capture the maximum number of pieces, the player may choose. Within a multicapture, turning 180 degrees between two captures is not allowed. A man that promotes to king by jumping continues to jump (if possible) as part of the same move.<br><br>A player wins if the opponent has no legal move, either because all his pieces are captured or he is completely blocked.

"com.lattanzio.generala"	"Generala"	"100000"	"4.4"	"<div jsname=""sngebd"">Generala is a game played by two or more players. Players take turns rolling five dice. After each roll, the player chooses which dice (if any) to keep, and which to reroll. A player may reroll some or all of the dice up to three times on a turn.<br><br>The following combinations earn points:<br>	•	Ones, Twos, Threes, Fours, Fives or Sixes. A player may add the numbers on any combination of dice showing the same number. For example, 4-4-4-2-6 would score 4 + 4 + 4 = 12 points in ""Fours"" or 2 points in ""Twos"" or even 6 points in ""Sixes"". Once a player has taken points on a specific combination, he or she may not take points for that combination again during the game.<br>	•	Straight. 20 points. A straight is any combination of dice in order: 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, or 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Additionally, in a straight, a 1 can be placed after a 6, meaning a 3, 4, 5, 6 and 1 is also legal. A variation of this rule includes all combinations where only one number is missing, e.g. 1, 2, 4, 5, 6 or 1, 2, 3, 4, 6. Another variation allows a 1 to replace a 2 in a straight, e.g. 1, 1, 3, 4, 5 or 1, 3, 4, 5, 6.<br>	•	Full house. 30 points. Any set of three combined with a set of two. For example, 5-5-5-3-3.<br>	•	Four of a kind. 40 points. Four dice with the same number. For example, 2-2-2-2-6.<br>	•	Generala. 50 or 60 points. All five dice with the same number.<br>	•	Double Generala (optional). 100 or 120 points. All five dice with the same number for the second time in a game.<br><br>A player may choose in which qualifying category to score a roll. For example, one need not enter 3-3-3-3-3 in Generala – it may also go in Threes or Four of a kind.<br>If a player makes a Straight, Full House, or Four of a Kind on the first roll of a given turn, it is worth 5 or 10 extra points. A player who makes Generala on the first roll of a turn automatically wins the game.<br>A player who fails to make any valid score, or chooses not to take any other score, may scratch (eliminate) a category, such as Generala or Twos. If a player scratches a category, that player cannot score on that category for the rest of the game. Specifically, if a player scratches Generala and subsequently rolls Generala on the first roll of a turn, it may not be used as an automatic win.<br>The winner, if no one scores an automatic Generala win, is the player who finishes the game with the most points.</div>"	"0.00"	"Board"	"3136"

"com.lecherbault.axis"	"Axis"	"5"	"0"	"<div jsname=""sngebd"">LE JEU<br><br>Axis est un jeu original créé par Alain Lecherbault, créateur français. Axis est à l'origine un jeu de plateau devant opposer 2 adversaires physiques en 6 manches gagnantes lors de compétitions internationales. <br><br>L'application du Jeu d'Axis est une alternative à ce jeu de plateau. Ici, vous jouez contre la machine, et vous découvrez votre niveau de jeu. Ce niveau de jeu, appelé ""Grade"", est une évaluation officielle relevant d'un calcul très pointu alliant scores et façon de jouer. Il a été mis au point par l'auteur lui-même au terme de milliers de parties observées. Ce calcul est appliqué au terme de 6 manches gagnées par l'un des joueurs.   <br><br>RÈGLES<br><br>Après un classique tirage au sort, les joueurs (pour l'application, l'adversaire principal est un algorithme) déposent tour à tour un pion sur l'une des cases libres du plateau. On appelle ce pion le pion d'Axis.<br><br>Lorsqu'un joueur place son pion d'Axis sur un axe horizontal, vertical ou diagonal qui comporte déjà au moins 3 pions de sa couleur, le joueur ""prend"" cet axe, c'est à dire qu'il ajoute non seulement autant de pions que l'axe comporte de cases vides mais capture aussi les pions de l'adversaire ; les pions ""pris"" à l'adversaire sur cet axe sont déduits du score de ce dernier. Il n'est pas nécessaire que les pions du joueur soient contigus sur l'axe de prise pour effectuer la prise.<br><br>Le pion d'Axis placé lors d'un coup peut décider de la prise de plusieurs axes en même temps pour autant que la condition de ""prise"" soit réunie sur chacun des axes où se trouve ce pion (4 pions au minimum). <br><br>Une partie d'Axis s'achève lorsque toutes les cases du plateau sont dotées de pions. C'est le joueur qui a fait le meilleur score qui est déclaré vainqueur de la manche. Une partie complète d'Axis s'effectue en 6 manches gagnantes. <br><br>A l'issue d'une partie, et selon le nombre de points et de manches acquis, le joueur se voit attribuer ou non un grade de jeu: Écuyer(1), Chevalier(2), Baron(3), Duc(4) ou Prince(5). Ce grade est acquis pour toujours: c'est en fait le niveau avec lequel le joueur peut être confronté à d'autres joueurs lors de compétitions internationales. Attention, le ""grade"" n'est pas systématiquement attribué si le niveau de jeu est faible.<br><br>HIGHSCORE<br><br>Un système de highscore est intégré au jeu: les 10 meilleurs scores sont enregistrés en ligne et affichés. Une aide complète en français et en anglais est fourni avec le jeu.<br><br>Axis est un jeu totalement gratuit et nécessite une connexion internet pour activer le highscore.</div>"	"0.00"	"Board"	"0"

""A ten-year old classic brought back to life on mobile.

Jaipur is a fast-paced card game for two players with a blend of tactics, risk and luck. You are one of the most powerful traders in Jaipur, the capital city of Rajasthan. You and your opponent duel to demonstrate to the Maharajah that you can earn a greater profit than your competition. At the end of a round, one player receives the Maharajah's seal of excellence, and the first player to earn two seals of excellence wins the privilege of being invited to the Maharajah’s court! <br><br>Each turn, you can choose to take one card, exchange your cards for other goods, buy the camels needed to transport your wares, or sell at the market. The sooner you sell and the more you sell of a single good at once, the higher your profit. <br><br>If you take cards, you have to choose between taking all the camels, taking 1 card from the market or swapping 2 to 5 cards between the market and your cards. If you sell cards, you get to sell only one type of good per turn, and you get as many chips from that good as you sold cards.

Также возможны вопросы, в которых Ведущему предлагается выбрать из нескольких вариантов. Если ведущий считает, что на вопрос нельзя ответить однозначно - он также может ответить ""Некорректно"".<br>Возможно напрямую спрашивать ведущего числа, потому что их легко можно отгадать перебором.<br><br>Например, загадывается ситуация: «Человек на вокзале покупает в кассе билет, ему говорят ""Поезд через 13 минут"". Человек смотрит на билет и выбрасывает, почему?».<br><br>Процесс отгадывания может выглядеть так:<br>— Он подбирает билет в дальнейшем?<br>— Нет.<br>— Поехал ли этот человек куда-нибудь, используя билет?<br>— Нет.<br>— Человек выбросил билет из-за суеверности?<br>— Нет.<br>— Был ли этот человек один?<br>— Да.<br>...<br><br>В чем же особенность приложения ""Данетки"" ?<br><br>- Наше приложение это сборник лучших данеток, в которые мы когда-либо играли.

Only one pawn can stand on a zone or square except on a safe zone or square which marked with special design patterns. So if player X’s pawn stands on a zone and player Y’s pawn is moving to the same zone then player Y pawn can kill Player X’s pawn. Then player X’s pawn will go back to the starting zone and gets blocked again.<br><br>4.	The game grid is divided into 3 lanes outer, middle and inner. Player has to kill at least one opponent’s pawn to enter into middle lane.(This rule excluded from my game)<br><br>5.

"com.nextpagetechnologies.tictacdrag"	"Tic Tac Drag"	"50"	"5"	"<div jsname=""sngebd"">Tic tac drag is a fun game that you can play any time and anywhere. Tic tac drag is not a zero sum game, which means that if both players are playing their best, that either of player will win. However, if you learn how to play tic tac drag and master some simple strategies, then you'll be able to not only play, but to win the majority of the time. <br><br>1.Tic Tag Drag board is made up of a 3 x 3 grid.<br><br>2. Have the first player go first. We have ""X"" and ""O"" symbols as coins. Usually the first player goes with ""X"". These symbols will be placed on the board, in the attempt to have three of them in a row. If you're going first, then the best move you can make is to move into the center. This will maximize your chances of winning, since you'll be able to create a row of three ""X""s or ""O""s in more combinations (4) this way than if you chose a different position.<br><br>3. Have the second player go second. After the first player goes, then the second player should put down his symbol, which will be different from the symbol of the first player. The second player can either try to block the first player from creating a row of three, or focus on creating his or her own row of three. Ideally, the player can do both.<br><br>4.Keep alternating moves until one of the players has drawn a row of three symbols or until no one can win. The first player to draw three of his or her symbols in a row, whether it is horizontal, vertical, or diagonal, has won tic tac drag. However, if both players are playing with optimal strategy, then there's a good chance to play more time because you will have blocked all of each other's opportunities to create a row of three.<br>5.Keep practicing. Contrary to popular belief, tic tac drag isn't purely a game of chance. There are some strategies that can help you optimize your skills and to become an expert tic tac drag player. If you keep playing, you'll soon learn all of the tricks to making sure you win every time -- or, at least, you'll learn the tricks to make sure you never lose. Its like 0's and x's.<br><br><br>Becoming an Expert<br><br>1.Make the best first move. <br>The best move, if you go first, is to go in the center. There are no ifs, ands, or buts about it. If you go in the middle, you will have the highest chance of winning the game. And if you let your opponent go there, you will have the highest chance of losing. And you don't want that, do you?<br>If you don't go in the center, your next best move is to go in one of the four corners. That way, if your opponent does not choose the center (and a novice player may not), then you have a high chance of winning.<br>Avoid the edges as a first move. The edges are the four positions that are neither the center or the corner. If you go here first, you will have the smallest chance of winning.<br><br>2. React appropriately if the other player goes first. <br>If the other player goes first and does not go in the center, then you should go in the center. But if the other player does go in the center, then your best bet is to place your symbol on one of the corner positions.<br><br>3. Follow the ""right, left, above, and below"" strategy. <br>This is another sure-fire strategy that will help you win the game. When your opponent makes a mark, see if you can place your symbol to the right of his symbol. If you can't, then see if you can place it to the left. If you can't, then move it above your opponent's symbol. And finally, if that doesn't work, see if you can move your mark below your opponent's. This strategy ensures that you'll be most successful at optimizing your position and blocking your opponent from scoring.<br>4. Use the three-corner strategy. <br>Another strategy for winning the game of tic tac drag is to place your symbols in three of the four corners of the board. This can optimize your chances of getting three in a row because you'll be able to create a diagonal row or rows along the sides of the grid. This will work if your opponent does not completely thwart you, of course.</div>"	"0.00"	"Board"	"14"

"com.paleblue.snakeladder"	"Snakes And Ladders"	"100000"	"4.1"	"<div jsname=""sngebd"">Snakes and Ladders is an ancient Indian board game regarded today as a worldwide classic. It is played between two or more players on a gameboard having numbered, gridded squares. A number of ""ladders"" and ""snakes"" are pictured on the board, each connecting two specific board squares. The object of the game is to navigate one's game piece, according to die rolls, from the start (bottom square) to the finish (top square), helped or hindered by ladders and snakes respectively.The game is a simple race contest based on sheer luck, and is popular with young children. The historic version had root in morality lessons, where a player's progression up the board represented a life journey complicated by virtues (ladders) and vices (snakes).<br><br>How to<br>Each player starts with a token on the starting square (usually the ""1"" grid square in the bottom left corner, or simply, off the board next to the ""1"" grid square) and takes turns to roll a single die to move the token by the number of squares indicated by the die roll. Tokens follow a fixed route marked on the gameboard which usually follows a boustrophedon (ox-plow) track from the bottom to the top of the playing area, passing once through every square. If, on completion of a move, a player's token lands on the lower-numbered end of a ""ladder"", the player must move the token up to the ladder's higher-numbered square. If the player lands on the higher-numbered square of a ""snake"" (or chute), the token must move down to the snake's lower-numbered square.<br>If a player rolls a 6, the player may, after moving, immediately take another turn; otherwise play passes to the next player in turn. The player who is first to bring their token to the last square of the track is the winner.<br>A variation exists where a player must roll the exact number to reach the final square to win. Depending on the particular variation, if the roll of the die is too large the token either remains in place or goes off the final square and back again. For example, if a player requiring a 3 to win rolls a 5, they would move forward three spaces and then back two again. In certain circumstances (such as a person requiring a 1to win rolling a 6), a player can end up further from the final square after this move than before it.</div>"	"0.00"	"Board"	"1264"

It allows you to play 1 player or 2 players games.  In one player games, you will be playing against the device against machine AI (Artificial Intelligence) algorithm.  In two player games, you can take turns with your friend/family to play the game on the mobile hone or tablet.  <br><br>The game comes with multiple difficulty levels from each to hard, simply use the slider to adjust the computer opponent strength.  If the computer opponent is too hard to beat, just adjust the difficulty level before starting the game. <br><br>The easiest difficulty level has a not so smart opponent and sometimes it will make silly moves, this is a good opponent for beginners to chess.<br><br>The most difficult opponent is at the highest level, and the algorithm will take its time to think ahead and consider the best moves.  It can trap you and catch you off-guard with fancy/unpredictable moves.  It should provide good challenge for seasoned casual players.<br><br>The game comes with several beautiful boards set and chess pieces.  Chose the one you like before starting a game, or you can even swap them in the middle of the game from within the Option screen.  Select the board appearance from wood textures to classic black/gray and white checkerboards.  Select the piece-set, from flat 2D style to beautiful classic pieces.  <br><br><b>Summary Of Features</b><br>- Chess game with 1-player and 2-player mode.  Human vs Computer or Human vs Human.<br>- Adjust opponent strength/difficulty levels for variety of challenges and skill levels.<br>- Option to change the board appearance.<br>- Option to change the pieces appearance.<br>- Statistics screen keeps track of the number of plays, winnings, losing, and ties.<br>- Animated movement shows where pieces are moving from.<br>- Highlighting feature help to show the moves that you can make.<br><br>Background:<br>This game is intended for casual players. The algorithm utilizes ""alpha-beta pruning"" to provide the computer opponent with their intelligence.  This method should provide the computer opponent with reasonable strength to challenge most casual chess players.  The higher the difficulty levels, the more time it will take for the computer algorithm to find the best moves.  If you're the impatient type and wants quick games, set the difficulty level to under 3 (there are 5 difficulty levels levels in the game).<br><br>If you're a beginner chess player, we recommend using the lowest opponent difficulty.  Note that this app won't teach you how to play chess; it assumes that you know the basic rules of chess, such as what moves each piece can make (although it will highlight valid moves, you need to know chess rules to outmaneuver the opponent), or what ""check"" or ""checkmate"" means.  The app may make special moves such as ""En-passant"" and ""Castling.""</div>"	"0.00"	"Board"	"368"

Bing over your Facebook friends for real time multiplayer matches.<br><br>Ludo /ˈluːdoʊ/, /ˈljuː-/ (from Latin ludo, ""I play"") is a classic strategy board game for two to four players, in which the players race their four tokens from start to finish according to the rolls of a single die (dice). Like other cross and circle games, Ludo is derived from the Indian game Pachisi (Parcheesi), but simpler. The game and its variations are popular in many countries and under various names.<br><br>Rules:<br><br>Each player gets to choose tokens of one of the four colors (green, yellow, red or blue). These tokens must make a full turn of the board and then make it to the finish line. The player who gets all four tokens to the finish line first is the winner.<br>However, each move can only be made based on the number decided by casting a six-sided dice, and each token can only move out of their home by casting a number six on the dice. Additionally, the competition factor of the games is upped by the fact that while moving if another player’s token lands on the same square as your token, then your token will automatically be sent back home and you’ll need to roll a six again.<br><br><br>Ludo Classic Features:<br>★ Play Multiplayer games with Facebook friends<br>★ Play Random Online Real Time Multiplayer Matches<br>★ Create Private Table and invite friends &amp; family<br>★ Play OFFLINE also with friends.<br><br>Coming Up:<br>★ Rule Customisation like Nepali Rules, Doubling of pieces, double dice roll etc<br>★ Chat and send emoticons to other players while you play.<br>★ Send Gifts and make situations funny<br>★ Get Daily bonus<br>★ Get Star in this Dice game with every multiplayer win<br><br><br>Fun Facts:<br>★ In North America, the game is sold under the brand name Parcheesi.<br>★ In Iran, the game is called ""منچ""<br>★ In Polish it is commonly referred to as Chińczyk (""The Chinese"")<br>★ In Estonia, it is called ""Reis ümber maailma"" (Trip around the world).<br>★ In Greece, the game is called ""Γκρινιάρης"" [Griniaris] (""Grumbler"") referring to typical player behavior.<br>★ In Malaysia and Singapore, it is called ""飞机棋"".<br>★ In Sweden it is known as ""Fia"", a name derived from the Latin word fiat which means ""so be it!""

"com.ptn.gameoffline2048"	"Offline game 2048"	"1000"	"2.7"	"<div jsname=""sngebd"">How to play<br>1. Know how to play. You might know how to play this 2048 offline game. But just in case there may be someone who does not know, here are the basics.<br>-Swipe your screen up, down, left, or right to move all numeric boxes in the desired direction. Each box moves in the desired direction until it is stuck on the other side (not just moving one plot).<br>-Every time you make one move, one new box 2 or 4 will appear in a random location.<br><br>2. Try creating a box with the number 2048. When a movement makes two boxes that have the same number meet, the two boxes will blend into a new box of the two numbers. For example, two boxes 2 will merge into boxes 4. The purpose of this game is to create a box that has a number 2048.<br><br>3. Think about your movements carefully and forwards. When playing the game, you can easily fall asleep to move as fast as possible. If you want to win, fight the impulsive effect and make a move when you are sure that it is the right move. Look at the future possibilities that will occur and imagine what the board will look like after you make the next move, or at least what will happen to some important boxes on the offline 2048 game board.<br><br>4. Focus on the corner of the offline game 2048. The most common strategy used by many players is to create and develop the biggest number in the corner. Any corner is not a problem, obviously once you choose a corner, stick to the corner. This tactic is the most effective, especially the line where your corner is fully loaded, because that will allow you to move in one direction without changing the important box. Because if you use this tactic, you can usually only use two-way movements freely (up / down and right / left).<br><br>5. Take advantage of 2048 offline gaming opportunities to join two boxes. If you see more than two boxes that can be combined in one motion, usually combining them all at once is a good move because it will give you more room to move for the next.<br><br>6. Swipe offline games 2048 in two directions alternately. One of the fundamental approaches in this game is to move the board in two directions (right / left and up / down) continuously until there is no moving box. If there are no boxes that can be moved, do one move in the opposite direction from the one you specified, then go back to doing the two initial movements continuously offline game 2048. This will not guarantee you win (in fact, you will usually not win only by this). But, this will give you a high score, and is a fast way to beat your previous record. When you have determined the two directions of your movement, for example right and top, do not move in another direction unless the board cannot be moved anymore.</div>"	"0.00"	"Board"	"7"

However, each move can only be made based on the number decided by casting 4 cowries, and each token can only move out of their home by casting a Four (all cowries facing up) or Eight (all cowries facing down). Additionally, the competition factor of the games is upped by the fact that while moving if another player’s token lands on the same square as your token (except 4 designated Homes, which are safe zones), then your token will be considered as “killed” and automatically be sent back to your home and you’ll need to roll a Four or Eight again. Only if you kill opponent’s token, then you can move to inside square and hence reach the finishing home. Alternatively, you can watch a video ad to move to inside square.</div>"	"0.00"	"Board"	"46"

Green, yellow or red radio waves will indicate whether or not Mr X is nearby. You can also question witnesses at important buildings across the city. The camera comes into play again, showing Tower Bridge, the Houses of Parliament and St Paul’s Cathedral in 3D. Witnesses will reveal whether Mr X is or has recently been there. <br><br>Furthermore, the detectives can determine his possible locations by analysing his previous moves, or by measuring the distance between Mr X and the nearest radio mast. But if you think you’ve already got Mr X in the bag, you can think again. With his new escape option, the helicopter, he’s as cunning as ever. He can also win the game by reaching two of five pre-determined rendezvous points.<br><br>The innovative combination of the classic board game and digital gaming fun guarantees an engrossing experience for the whole family!</div>"	"0.00"	"Board"	"1562"

Enjoy hours of entertainment with our version with 3 games in one – traditional Backgammon, Narde and Fevga. <br>Backgammon is one of the oldest board games known. It is a two player game where playing pieces are moved according to the roll of dice, and a player wins by removing all of their pieces from the board before their opponent. <br><br>The roll of the dice indicates how many points, the player is to move his checkers. The checkers are always moved forward. The following rules apply:<br>- The numbers on the two dice constitute separate moves. For example, if a player rolls 5 and 3, he may move one checker five spaces to an open point and another (or same) checker three spaces to an open point.<br>- A player who rolls doubles plays the numbers shown on the dice twice. A roll of 6 and 6 means that the player has four sixes to use.<br>- A player must use both (or all 4 for doubles) numbers of a roll if this is legally possible. When only one number can be played, the player must play that number. Or if either number can be played but not both, the player must play the larger one.<br>- Once a player has moved all of his fifteen checkers into his home board, he may commence bearing off. A player bears off a checker by rolling a number that corresponds to the point on which the checker resides, and then removing that checker from the board. If there is no checker on the point indicated by the roll, you must make a legal move using a checker on a higher-numbered point.

If it's a bomb then the game is over.  If not then you get another turn.  Numbers will display when there are mines found in the eight surrounding cells.  Use this information along with strategy and logic to determine where mines are located on the board.<br><br>Pro Tips:<br><br>Once you discover a mine drag a flag over the tile to mark it as suspect.  It also prevents accidental touches from triggering a tile you know has a bomb under it.  When all flags have been placed on the board a green check appears. Tap the checkmark to watch all non-flag tiles blast away and see if you've won the battle.  Another benefit to using this approach is you won't be charged extra moves which means you'll get a higher score.  You don't have to use flags though and can just uncover all tiles without mines to win the game.  <br><br>Scoring:<br><br>You can get huge score bonuses to boost your score to the top of the Leaderboard. You will receive an initial score based on number of moves and the time it took to win.  Each day you play, your score is multiplied by the number of days up to a maximum of 5. Each consecutive game you win, your score is multiplied by the number of wins up to a maximum of 5. That means when combined you can make your final score up to 10 times bigger!<br><br>Features:<br><br>- Three difficulty levels: Classic (8x8), Professional (16x16), Expert (16x30)<br>- Multiple color themes: Dark, Bright, Classic<br>- Awards and Statistics for tracking progress<br>- Google+ leaderboards and achievements<br>- Optimized for Android smartphones and tablet displays</div>"	"0.00"	"Board"	"481"

Abalone has been one of the best games around for nearly 30 years, known for its hexagonal board and black and white marbles. The goal of this abstract board game is simple: push your opponent’s marbles off the board! But beware, it’s not easy to master, so keep your wits about you and rise to the challenge! <br><br>HAVE A PLAN OF ATTACK...<br><br>Create a plan of attack to push your opponent’s marbles off the board. On every turn, you can move one space in any direction with 1, 2, or 3 lined-up marbles. When you’re in a Sumito position (that is, when your marbles both outnumber and are in contact with your opponent’s) you can push their marbles out! For example, you need three black marbles to push one or two white marbles. There’s no use in rushing; it’s better to take your time and think of every possibility since one hasty move can put you in a bad position and let victory slip through your fingers. <br><br>...AND HAVE A STRONG DEFENSE. <br><br>If you want to win, the key is not to attack, but rather to take specific positions with certain combinations of moves. Just like in chess and checkers, you can try to create traps by sacrificing marbles or strategic positions to block your opponent. The most dangerous contact points are at the edges of the board, where a bad move means losing a marble or the whole game! Sometimes, it’s better to be patient if you want to win! <br><br>DON’T CONFUSE FORESIGHT AND HASTE <br><br>The keys to victory are looking ahead and analyzing your opponent’s play. Although the game is easy to learn, it requires strategy and thought. To hone your strategic thinking, the game offers several modes that let you review your games play by play. For example, Challenge Mode helps you become a true Abalone master, one move at a time. The challenges get harder as you advance. For example, at first you must push out a single marble only to win a challenge, then two, and the master will get progressively tougher. <br><br>PLAY ALONE OR WITH FRIENDS <br><br>Play alone against the computer with Challenge Mode and Free Play Mode, or play against your friends.

How often you all wondered if we have a Ludo game in the wooden board? The board that we used to play when we were kids. The very smell of the wood, the sketching of colors, the die (dice) and tokens that will take us back to our childhood days.<br><br>I kept this very experience as my goal when I designed the game for you all to cherish those childhood moments. So, get ready and travel back to old days and rule the Ludo kingdom.<br><br>ABOUT<br><br>Ludo is a strategy board game for 2 to 4 players and is being widely played in India, Nepal, Algeria and many Asian, Latin, European countries. It is also called as Parchisi, Parcheesi, and Laadhuu. The goal is simple, each player has to race their four tokens from start to finish (home) according to rolls of a single die or dice.<br><br>DESIGN<br><br>You got classic wood and neo-Ludo boards (paper &amp; white). The wood board, die &amp; tokens are a timeless design. It gives you a better visual experience and nostalgic feelings. The sketch marks and crystal clear tokens will make us feel the same old classic ludo board.<br><br>The board is the square shape with 3 columns of squares and supports up to 4 players (2, 3 &amp; 4 players in combination with Computer). Each player will take one color from bright yellow, green, red and blue. You can also assign all players as Computer and quietly watch each, it is quite a lot fun. :)<br><br>DIE ROLLING<br><br>I built an entirely new physics engine for die-rolling mechanics that will simulate the real-time rolling of a die or dice. The physics behind die-rolling was very challenging and I am proud to be the first one to implement.

When four or more capsule halves or viruses of matching color are aligned in vertical or horizontal configurations, they are removed from play. The main objective is to complete levels, which is accomplished by eliminating all viruses from the playing field. A game over occurs if capsules fill up the playing field in a way that obstructs the bottle's narrow neck. <br><br>Players can select the degree of starting difficulty any time a new game is started. The initial level chosen is a value between zero and twenty that determines the number of viruses to clear, and the three game speed options change how fast the capsules fall in the bottle. The player's score is based solely on the elimination of viruses, not on the time taken to complete the level or the number of capsules used. If players complete the highest difficulty level, they can continue playing to accumulate a higher score, but the number of viruses to clear remains the same. Additional points are awarded when multiple viruses are eliminated at once, but no additional points are awarded for initiating chain reactions, in which the elimination of one set of objects triggers the elimination of another set. The game speed is also a factor in how the game calculates scoring; higher speed levels yield more points.</div>"	"0.00"	"Board"	"1034"

As an example in Yatzy game, one of the categories is called Three of a Kind. The scoring rule for this category means that a player only scores if at least three of the five dice are the same value.

"eco.d.chess"	"Chess Arena - King Royal Battle"	"10000"	"4.3"	"<div jsname=""sngebd"">Together with backgammona, chess is one of the oldest known board games. It is a two-player intelligent strategy board game played on a chessboard, a checkers gameboard with 64 squares arranged in an 8×8 grid. The game is played by millions of people worldwide. Rumour has it that the sharp people are prone to excel at the game. Each player begins with 16 pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two knights, two bishops, and eight pawns. Each of the six piece types moves differently, with the most powerful being the queen and the least powerful the pawn. The objective is to checkmate the opponent's king by placing it under an inescapable threat of capture. To this end, a player's pieces are used to attack and capture the opponent's pieces, while supporting each other. In addition to checkmate, the endgame can be achieved by voluntary resignation of the opponent, which typically occurs when too much material is lost or checkmate appears inevitable.

"fun.smuddana.www.tigersandgoats"	"TigerAndGoats"	"10"	"5"	"<div jsname=""sngebd"">This is the smallest and simplest variation of tigers and goats board game popular in villages since ancient times in India and Nepal. In this version there is 1 tiger and 5 goats. Tiger is already on the board and so goats move first. All 5 goats have be placed on the board before they can move. Tiger can kill a goat by jumping over a goat like in checkers. Goats win if tiger is encircled by goats and cannot move. Since it takes at least 4 goats to encircle a tiger, it is a tiger win if it kills 2 goats. If played correctly it is an easy win for goats. There is ""undo"" to take back a move. And there is ""hint"" for goats so not much of a challenge. Hence it is suited for small kids. With 1 goat killed, there is a very small chance that goats can still win. That is a good challenge to find those positions. In the other variations there are 3 tigers-15 goats, 4 tigers-20 goats and with bigger boards so the games are little more involved. I will publish those games later. Have fun playing!<br><br>START will restart the game. START can be pressed anytime to restart.<br>With PCMOVE the computer will make the move either for the tiger or for the goats. A computer move for the  tiger will always be a kill move if available but otherwise a random move. A computer move for the goats is always a winning move if there is one or a move to avoid getting killed or a random move, in that order. Users can switch sides even during the game as often as desired! And by keep pressing PCMOVE one can make the computer play the game to the end.<br>UNDO will revert the previous move. Any number of moves can be undone in reverse order.<br>HINT will give a winning move for the goats if there is one. With all five goats on board there is usually a winning move for the goats. With 4 goats, very few positions have winning move for the goats. And for the tiger, there are no hints!</div>"	"0.00"	"Board"	"3"

"game.bead16.shologutigame"	"Sixteen Soldiers"	"100000"	"4.7"	"<div jsname=""sngebd""><b>Sixteen Soldiers</b> is a two-player abstract strategy board game from Sri Lanka. It also comes from India under the name Cows and Leopards. A variant of this game is also popular in Bangladesh, where it is known as <b>Sholo guti</b> (Sixteen pieces).<br><br>The game is similar to draughts and Alquerque as players hop over one another's pieces to capture them. However, unlike draughts and standard Alquerque, the game is played on an expanded Alquerque board consisting of four triangular boards attached to the four sides of an Alquerque board. Also, pieces can move and capture in any direction from the beginning. <br><br>There is no promotion to King. Its actual closest relatives are Peralikatuma and Kotu Ellima which are also from the Indian subcontinent. The only real difference between these three closely related games is the number of pieces. In Sixteen Soldiers, each player has 16 pieces hence the name of the game. In Peralikatuma, each player has 23 pieces. In Kotu Ellima, each player has 24 pieces. Sixteen Soldiers is also related to the Indonesian game of Permainan-Tabal.<br><br>In Sholo guti, players can agree beforehand the number of opposing pieces to be captured to win the game.<br><br><b> Goal </b><br>The player who captures all the other player's pieces wins. In the case of Sholo guti, the number of opposing pieces to be captured that both players agree upon.<br><br><b> Game Play and Rules </b><br><br>1. Players decide what colors to play, and who starts first. Players alternate their turns, and only use one piece to either move or capture per turn.<br><br>2. Each players pieces are initially set up on the first four ranks of their side of the board.<br><br>3. A piece moves one space per turn in any direction following the pattern on the board onto an unoccupied point on the board.<br><br>4. A piece can capture an enemy piece in any direction by the short leap as in draughts or Alquerque. The player's piece must be adjacent to the enemy piece, and leap over it onto a vacant point on the other side. The leap must be in a straight line following the pattern on the board. The same piece can continue to capture and even change direction to capture provided capturing requirements are satisfied. Captures are compulsory. A piece must continue to capture if it is able to do so. Captured pieces are removed from the board.<br><br>5. If a player does not capture any enemy piece during their turn, but was actually able to do so, then the other player removes that piece that failed to make its capture from the board. If there is more than one piece to choose from, any one will do. The piece is said to be ""huffed"", and then removed.<br><br>6. If a player has more than one option to capture, then the player can choose any one (and only one) of them.<br><br>Features:<br> Simple UI and attractive design<br> Single player vs Second Player - play with Computer<br> Smooth animations<br> Good game for kids to learn sholo guti strategy<br> 2 player game <br> Play totally offline<br> Perfect family board games a kind of smart strategy Board game<br> Best Board game and true family board game<br><br>In old times, players draw the cort of this board game on the ground and uses stones as pawns and player used stones cross as pawns for tiger trap.

When this occurs, the opponent's discs that you have surround become yours.<br>* If one player cannot make a valid move, the player must pass and the other player plays again.<br>* The game is over when the entire board is filled or when no side can make a valid move.<br>* The winner of the game is the one with the most discs when the game is over.<br><br>NOTES: Ultima Reversi Pro has an ""Auto Pass"" feature that automatically passes your turn if you have no other move available and must pass.</div>"	"2.49"	"Board"	"79"

Для игры используют 5 шестигранных кубиков с числовыми достоинствами от 1 до 6. В зависимости от игровой ситуации, выбрасываются от одного до пяти кубиков одновременно. За выполнение определённых комбинаций даются очки. Все комбинации и результаты их выполнения записываются в таблицу. Чтобы начать игру необходимо накидать 50 очков(вход в игру). Кубики сначала кидают все 5 штук. Например выпало 1,5,2,2,6 – это 15 очков. 1 и 5 откладывают, а остальные кидают. Если ничего не выпало – пишут болт, а если все 5 кубиков были накиданы, то можно кинуть их все и то что выпало приплюсовать к тому что уже накидали. Далее игрок сам решает кидать еще или записать в таблицу. После того как один из игроков все же прошел «вход игру» он должен пройти 2 ямы и бочку : первая яма с 200 до 300, вторая с 600 до 700.<br>Пример прохождения одной из ям(200-300):<br>У игрока 195 очков.<br><br>1) Он кидает кубики, ему выпало 60. Он может кидать дальше, а может записать и у него будет на бочке 255 очков. Потом ему надо будет накидать 45 очков обязательно чтобы выйти из бочки.<br><br>2) Ему выпало 10 очков, если запишет ему придется накидывать 95 очков чтобы «вылезти» из бочки.<br><br>При наборе игроком 555 очков(самосвал) он начинает игру с 0, но уже без<br>«входа в игру»<br><br>Бочка начинается с 880 по 1000 очков. Если игрок сидит на бочке, то он обязан сразу набрать 1000 или более очков. Для выигрыша есть 3 попытки. Если эти три попытки не реализованы, то происходит падение с бочки, при этом списывается 100 очков. Всего можно упасть 3 раза, при этом на 3-й раз теряются все заработанные очки, игру приходится начинать сначала.<br><br>Как считать очки:<br>Очки приносят кубики достоинством  1 (10 очков) и  5 (5 очков), а также 3 и более кубика одного достоинства, выпавшие в текущем броске.<br>При этом 3 кубика дают очки по номиналу кубика умноженного на 10 (т.е. три четверки дадут 40 очков, а три единицы 100 (обратите внимание, что 1 во всей игре считается за 10 очков). <br>Четыре одинаковых кубика дают очки по номиналу, умноженного на 50 (например 4 тройки дадут 3*50=150 очков) <br>Пять одинаковых кубиков одного достоинства считаются за 1000 очков.<br><br>Особенности:<br># Это приложение позволяет бросить кости путем встряхивания телефона.<br># Простой и приятный  интерфейс.<br># Красивая графика. <br># Простое и удобное управление.</div>"	"0.00"	"Board"	"113"

A captured piece is left on the board until all captures in a sequence have been made but cannot be jumped again (Turkish capturing rules).<br>* A player with no valid move remaining loses. This is the case if the player either has no pieces left or if a player's pieces are obstructed from making a legal move by the pieces of the opponent. A game is a draw if neither opponent has the possibility to win the game. The game is considered a draw when the same position repeats itself for the third time, with the same player having the move each time. If one player proposes a draw and his opponent accepts the offer. If a player has three kings in the game against a single enemy king and his 15th move cannot capture enemy king.</div>"	"0.00"	"Board"	"18355"

I understand some of you may want to be more nuanced, and I do also appreciate 4-star ratings, but please notice that they don't help much; the bad guys give very low ratings, and currently even 4 stars pull the rank down, so the only real help comes from 5-star ratings and sensible review comments.</div>"	"0.00"	"Board"	"415"

"ru.appforge.backgammon"	"Backgammon"	"100000"	"4"	"<div jsname=""sngebd"">Backgammon is one of the oldest board games for two players. The playing pieces are moved according to the roll of dice, and a player wins by removing all of his pieces from the board before his opponent. Backgammon is a member of the tables family, one of the oldest classes of board games in the world.<br>Although luck is one of the determining factors in the outcome, strategy plays a more important role in the long run. With each roll of the dice, players must choose from numerous options for moving their checkers and anticipate possible counter-moves by the opponent.<br>	Backgammon playing pieces are known variously as checkers, draughts, stones, men, counters, pawns, discs, pips, chips, or nips.<br>Rules of classic backgammon are rather simple. The objective is to remove (bear off) all of one's own checkers from the board before one's opponent can do the same. The checkers are, in the most often-played variants, scattered at first, and may be blocked or hit by the opponent.<br>	To start the game, each player rolls one die, and the player with the higher number moves first using the numbers shown on both dice. If the players roll the same number, they must roll again as the first move cannot be a doublet. After rolling the dice, players must, if possible, move their checkers according to the number shown on each die. The same checker may be moved twice as long as the two moves are distinct.  If a player rolls two of the same number, called doubles, that player must play each die twice. For any roll, if a player can make moves corresponding to the numbers on both dice, that player is compelled to do so. If players cannot use the number from either die in a roll, given the position of their checkers, then that turn is over and the turn passes to the opponent. If moves can be made according to either one die or the other, but not both, the higher number must be used. If one die is unable to be moved, but such a move is made possible by the moving of the other die, that move is compulsory.<br>In the course of a move, a checker may land on any point that is unoccupied or is occupied by one or more of the player's own checkers. It may also land on a point occupied by exactly one opposing checker, or ""blot"". In this case, the blot has been ""hit"", and is placed in the middle of the backgammon board on the bar that divides the two sides of the playing surface. A checker may never land on a point occupied by two or more opposing checkers; thus, no point is ever occupied by checkers from both players simultaneously. There is no limit to the number of checkers that can occupy a point at any given time.<br>Checkers placed on the bar by being hit re-enter the game through the opponent's home board. Checkers may not enter on points that are occupied by two or more opposing checkers—these points are blocked. Checkers can enter on points occupied by a single opposing checker—this opposing checker is hit and goes to the bar, the same as any hit checker. A player may not move any other checkers until all checkers on the bar belonging to that player have re-entered the board.<br>When all of a player's checkers are in that player's home board, that player may start removing them; this is called ""bearing off"". <br>If one player has not borne off any checkers by the time that player's opponent has borne off all fifteen, then the player has lost a gammon, which counts for double a normal loss. If the losing player has not borne off any checkers and still has checkers on the bar or in the opponent's home board, then the player has lost a backgammon, which counts for three times a normal loss.<br>Backgammon game features:<br>- singleplayer game with strong AI (master of backgammon)<br>- multiplayer game on one device (hot seat)<br>- you can play backgammon online with friends<br>- ""cloud"" scoreboards and leaderboards<br>- online shop with 12 unique backgammon gameboards<br>- achievements and rewards<br>- comprehensive analytics of dice rolls<br>- random.org dice generation for fair game</div>"	"0.00"	"Board"	"1975"

The traditional Sino-European domino set consists of 28 dominoes, colloquially nicknamed bones, cards, tiles, tickets, stones, or spinners. Each domino is a rectangular tile with a line dividing its faceinto two square ends. Each end is marked with a number of spots or is blank. A domino set is a generic gaming device, similar to playing cards or dice, in that a variety of games can be played with a set. There are some extended domino sets (double 9 and double 12). They are used for Mexican train, Chicken Foot and similar games. Each country has it’s own set of dominoes games: England - muggins (All fives), scandinavian countries - Bergen, Mexico - Mexican train, Spain - Matador.<br>The earliest mention of dominos is from Song Dynasty China. Dominoes first appeared in Italy during the 18th century, and although it is unknown how Chinese dominos developed into the modern game.<br><br>General rules of dominoes:<br><br>Blocking game<br>The most basic dominos variant is for two players and requires a double six set. The 28 domino tiles are shuffled face down and form the stock or boneyard. Each player draws seven tiles; the remainder are not used. Once the players begin drawing tiles, they are typically placed on-edge before the players, so that each player can see his own domino tiles, but none can see the value of other players' tiles. Every player can thus see how many tiles remain in the other players' hands at all times during gameplay. One player begins by downing (playing the first tile) one of their tiles. In different games first tiles are also different. In Muggins player should start with the highest double (6-6), in Bergen the first move should be 0-0, in Mexican train each round starts with the next lower double. This tile starts the line of play, a series of tiles in which adjacent tiles touch with matching, i.e. equal, values. The players alternately extend the line of play with one tile at one of its two ends. The game ends when one player wins by playing their last tile, or when the game is blocked because neither player can play. If that occurs, whoever caused the block gets all of the remaining player points not counting their own.<br>Scoring game<br>Players accrue points during game play for certain configurations, moves, or emptying one's hand. Most scoring games use variations of the draw game. In Muggins (All fives) player must make the open ends of the layout add up to 5s or a multiple of five (5s, 10, 15, 20, etc.) In bergen player scores when numbers on the open ends are equal. If a player does not call ""domino"" before the tile is laid on the table, and another player says 'domino' after the tile is laid, the first player must pick up an extra domino. In Mexican train the double zero domino is scored as 50 points.<br>Draw game<br>In a draw game (blocking or scoring), players are additionally allowed to draw as many tiles as desired from the stock before playing a tile. The score of a game is the number of pips in the losing player's hand plus the number of pips in the stock. Most rules prescribe that two tiles need to remain in the stock. The Draw game is often referred to as simply ""dominos"".<br><br>Mexican train has arrived! Enjoy our dominos game with the full set of this game varieties!

The game made its way to England and was sold as ""Snakes and Ladders"", then in the United States as Chutes and Ladders.<br><br>Gyan chauper/Jnan chauper (game of wisdom), the version associated with the Jain philosophy encompassed the concepts like karma and Moksha.<br>The game was popular in ancient India by the name Moksha Patam. It emphasized destiny, as opposed to games such as pachisi, which focused on life as a mixture of skill (free will) and luck. The game has also been interpreted and used as a tool for teaching the effects of good deeds versus bad. The board was covered with symbolic images, the top featuring gods, angels, and majestic beings, while the rest of the board was covered with pictures of animals, flowers and people.The ladders represented virtues such as generosity, faith, and humility, while the snakes represented vices such as lust, anger, murder, and theft. The morality lesson of the game was that a person can attain salvation (Moksha) through doing good, whereas by doing evil one will inherit rebirth to lower forms of life. The number of ladders was less than the number of snakes as a reminder that a path of good is much more difficult to tread than a path of sins. Presumably, reaching the 100 represented the attainment of Moksha (spiritual liberation).<br>When the game was brought to England, the Indian virtues and vices were replaced by English ones in hopes of better reflecting Victorian doctrines of morality. Squares of Fulfillment, Grace and Success were accessible by ladders of Thrift, Penitence and Industry and snakes of Indulgence, Disobedience and Indolence caused one to end up in Illness, Disgrace and Poverty. While the Indian version of the game had snakes outnumbering ladders, the English counterpart was more forgiving as it contained each in the same amount. This concept of equality signifies the cultural ideal that for every sin one commits, there exists another chance at redemption.<br>The association of Britain’s Snakes and Ladders with India and gyan chauper began with the returning of colonial families from one of Britain’s most important imperial possessions, India. The décor and art of the early English boards of the 20th century reflect this relationship. By the 1940s, very few pictorial references to the Indian culture were found due to the economic demands of the war and the collapse of British rule in India. Although the game’s sense of morality has lasted through the game’s generations, the physical allusions to religious and philosophical thought in the game as presented in Indian models appear to have all but faded. There has even been evidence of a possible Buddhist version of the game existing in India during the Pala-Sena time period.<br>In Andhra Pradesh, this game is popularly called Vaikunthapali or Paramapada Sopana Patam (the ladder to salvation) in Telugu. In Hindi, this game is called Saanp aur Seedhi, Saanp Seedhi and Mokshapat.<br>In the original game the squares of virtue are: Faith (12), Reliability (51), Generosity (57), Knowledge (76), and Asceticism (78). The squares of vice or evil are: Disobedience (41), Vanity (44), Vulgarity (49), Theft (52), Lying (58), Drunkenness (62), Debt (69), Murder (73), Rage (84), Greed (92), Pride (95), and Lust (99).</div>"	"0.00"	"Board"	"10"
