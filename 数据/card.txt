Santase  (or Sixty six)  is very popular card game for two players. The goal of the game is to be the first player to score 66 points. if neither player scores 66 points, the player who take the final card wins. In the game we have only 24 cards ( from 9's to Aces) . Each player get six cards and we flip over one card which is the trump suite<br><br>Playing <br><br>One player plays a card, then the other player plays a card. High card of the same suit takes the cards. Aces are high. Alternatively, any card of the trump suit takes any card of another suit. <br><br>Each player then draws one card from the remaining cards in the deck. Winner draws first. <br><br>Kings and Queens <br><br>If you have the king and queen of the same suit, you may show it and score 20 points. King and queen of the trump suit scores 40. You may only do this if you are leading the turn (laying down first). Do it at the start of your turn. Leave the queen down and take back the king. <br><br>Exchanging the 9 <br><br>If you have the 9 of the trump suit in your hand you may exchange it for the displayed trump card. But only if you are leading the turn, and only at the start of your turn. <br><br>The Run-off <br><br>Once no more cards are available in the deck, play proceeds a little differently. The player who won the last hand lays down first. If the other player has a card of the same suit they must play it. If they do not, they must play a card from the trump suit if they have one. As before, play continues until one player scores 66 points or more, or all cards have been taken. <br><br>Card Scoring <br><br>In Santase, cards have the following values. Note that a ten is more powerful than a jack, queen or king. In other words, a ten takes a jack, queen or king. <br><br>9's = 0 points<br>J = 2 points<br>Q = 3 points<br>K = 4 points<br>10's = 10 points<br>A = 11 points <br><br>Closing the Deck <br><br>At any point in the game, provided there are at least 3 cards remaining in the deck plus the displayed trump card, a player may close the deck. To do this, turn over the displayed trump card. You must do this at the start of your turn and you must be leading (laying down first). Then the game proceeds as in the ""run-off"". There is danger in this play. If the player who closed does not score 66 points, the other player scores 3 points for the win. <br><br>Game Scoring <br><br>The player who wins the game scores one point. If the loser has fewer than 31 points (30 or less), the winner scores two points. If the loser has scored no points, the winner scores three. <br><br>Games are played to any point value the players agree on. Typically, the first person to reach 11 points wins.</div>"	"0.00"	"Card"	"192"

Se suman puntos dependiendo de las cartas recogidas o si se limpia la mesa de cartas. <br><br>El primer jugador o pareja que consigue 20 puntos gana la partida. <br><br>Las figuras tiene un valor especial: la sota vale 8, el caballo 9 y el rey 10. El resto de cartas tienen su propio valor. <br><br>COMO JUGAR A LA ESCOBA <br><br>Al principio de la partida el jugador 1 empezará a jugar como “mano”. El jugador situado a su izquierda es el que reparte las cartas y es llamado “pie”, repartirá 3 cartas por jugador, y situará 4 cartas boca arriba sobre el tapete. <br><br>En su turno, cada jugador intentará sumar 15 con una de sus cartas y con las del tapete. Si no puede debe descartar una carta que se situará en el tapete . <br><br>Si se consigue sumar 15 con TODAS las cartas del tapete, se consigue una “escoba” (se indica en el cuadro de cada jugador). <br><br>El jugador que reparte puede anotar 1 o 2 escobas si las cartas que deposita sobre el tapete suman 15 en uno o dos grupos de cartas, respectivamente. A esta escoba se le denomina ""ESCOBA DE MANO"". <br><br>Cuando los jugadores se quedan sin cartas, se reparten 3 cartas de nuevo hasta que se agota el mazo. Cuando esto sucede, las últimas cartas que quedan sobre el tapete las recoge el jugador que haya hecho la última baza. <br><br>Se hace recuento de puntos y se vuelve a barajar para empezar otro juego. Esta vez, el jugador que inicia el juego es el situado a la derecha del anterior. <br><br>La partida termina cuando un jugador alcanza o supera los 20 puntos. Si más de un jugador supera este límite, ganará el que tenga más puntos. <br><br>Al término de cada juego, se realizará recuento de puntos según las cartas que haya recogido y las escobas que ha conseguido cada jugador. <br><br>•Por cada escoba: 1 punto. <br>•Por tener la mayoría de los oros: 1 pto. Si hay empate se reparte 1 pto a cada uno. <br>•Por tener el 7 de oros: 1 pto. <br>•Por tener la mayoría de los sietes: 1 pto. Si hay empate se reparte 1 pto a cada uno. <br>•Por tener la mayoría de las cartas: 1 pto. Si hay empate se reparte 1 pto a cada uno. <br><br>CONTROLES <br>Pulsa sobre una carta para seleccionarla o anular la selección, tanto del tapete como de las tuyas. Únicamente es posible seleccionar una de tus cartas. Una vez realizada la selección pulsa el boton JUGAR. Si no puedes sumar 15, selecciona una de tus cartas y pulsa JUGAR para depositar esa carta sobre el tapete. <br><br>MUY IMPORTANTE: Si tiras una carta sin seleccionar ninguna carta del tapete, y con ésta se puede sumar 15, las ganará el Jugador situado a tu derecha, llamándose ""RENUNCIO"".</div>"	"0.00"	"Card"	"136"

But also in the centuries preceding and following that, they pioneered with their characteristic painting styles and emotional depictions on canvas. The power of paint, colors, brushes and spatulas, combined with the genius of the painters created a new world, elusive in between reality and abstraction. The Dutchman Johannes Vermeer conquered the world with one bright glance from the Girl with a Pearl Earring. This extraordinary painting has become an icon; the intense blue color of her headscarf is recognizable to anyone. The Mona Lisa, the most famous painting ever, was painted by Leonardo da Vinci and is on display in the Lourve in Paris. The faint smile on her face, painted so beautifully and with such precision, makes the Mona Lisa the most valued painting of all time. The genius Rembrandt van Rijn painted many self-portraits, and even the portraits he made of others reflect his own facial features. From enhancing goddesses painted in a drawing-like manner by Sandro Botticelli, to the sad faces by Titian and the emotional portraits by Frans Hals, some of the most beautiful portrait paintings have been collected for the Old Master Pairs.<br><br>Although the painters influenced and inspired each other, most paintings are immediately recognizable as distinctly coming from one of the old masters. Therefore, it will be no surprise that this memory game challenges you to expand your knowledge and refresh your memory regarding the old masters. In Old Master Pairs you seek and match two DIFFERENT portrait paintings from the same painter. One set of two cards always offers a clear relationship or clues. These vary from painting style, to visible attributes such as collars, flowers, and headdresses, or color and facial expression. <br><br>The Game Features...<br>- 30 sets of famous portrait paintings<br>- Reference to each painting and painter<br>- 4 different card layout to choose from (12, 24, 40, 60 cards)<br>- Game has tracks your time and score <br><br>Old Masters Matching Pairs contains an important source of knowledge that is valuable for the meaning of the art of painting.</div>"	"0.99"	"Card"	"0"

"au.tonyrowe.fivehundred"	"Five Hundred"	"1000"	"4"	"<div jsname=""sngebd"">500 is a popular bid and trick taking card game originating from the USA played by four players in teams of two, with partners sitting opposite each other. It is especially popular in Australia and New Zealand. The game is called 500 because the objective of the game is to be the first team to reach 500 points. <br><br>Player bid on how many tricks they can take based upon the hand dealt to them and the highest bid gets the chance to win the hand and the points.<br><br>In this version you have a computer partner playing against two computer opponents. The characteristics of your partner can be configured to suit your style of play. Your partner can be an aggressive bidder, moderate or conservative, as your desire.<br><br>Other options include<br><br>- NEW!!! Ability to REVIEW the previous hand, kitty and bids made<br>- Ability to tailor the playing of Misere<br>- Ability to tailor the rules according to local preferences<br>- Large Card display for smaller screens<br>- Ability to control game speed<br>- Ability to turn on/off game sounds<br>- Option to play 3 or 5 card kitty<br><br>Here are some tips on playing the game...<br><br>- Don't forget that when there is a trump suit, the highest trump is the joker , followed by the jack of the trump suit (right bower), the other jack of the same colour (left bower), then Ace, King, Queen, 10, 9, etc. down to 5 or 4.Therefore, if say, hearts are trumps, then the jack of diamonds in considered to be a heart for that hand. If diamonds are trumps, the jack of hearts becomes a diamond, conversely. This does not apply for a No Trumps or Misere Bid, naturally.<br><br>- The minimum number of tricks that can be bid is six. If you bid say ""six hearts"", you are saying that with your partner's help, you will try to win at least six tricks with hearts as trumps. How many hearts say would you need to feel confident of making a six hearts bid? There are plenty of thoughts about the bidding process available online, and you need to take the strength of your offsuit into account, ie. do you have many aces?, but as a general guide, perhaps 4 hearts would be a good start.<br><br>- If you win the bid, you get to pick up kitty, and need to discard any 3 (or 5) cards from the 13 available to you. As a guide, it is often a good idea to try to rid yourself of an offsuit of which you have no high cards, so that if that suit is led by the opposition during the hand, you are in a position to trump them if required.<br><br>- During play, if you are trying to make a bid, it is often a good idea to try to extract trumps from the opposition early in the hand, so that when it comes to playing your offsuit later, they are not in a position to trump your aces. But if you are trying to stop a bid being made, it is also a good idea to not lead trumps back to the opposition if you can help it, try to keep the precious trumps for trumping offsuit.<br><br>- When you can't follow the suit that was led, are you aren't looking to trump, you are said to be discarding. You should try to discard a low card from your strongest offsuit first, and your partner will pick up on this and believe that this suit is perhaps the best to lead to you later.<br><br>For many more tips on all things 500, a good website to visit is<br><br>http://www.specialksoftware.com/#500<br><br>To play 500 online against other people, try...<br><br>http://www.juliannegiffin.com<br><br>If you have any issues, please email<br>trowe67@gmail.com<br>and an update may be supplied.<br><br>Note to Samsung users who can't seem to access any menus, that these can be accessed by long pressing the bottom right ""recent apps"" button on the device.</div>"	"0.99"	"Card"	"125"

Card games are very popular everywhere. People enjoy them as they just kill boredom.<br><br>It is also known as MindiKot, Mendhi Coat, Mindi Multiplayer, Dehla Pakad (means ""Collect the tens"") ! <br><br>A slight variation of Mindi is also known as Coat piece. Mindi is considered to be a game for smart people and needs some strategy to win it.<br><br>Mindi is designed for four players playing in two partnerships. The game uses a standard 52 card deck. The ranking of the cards in this deck are as follows (from high to low); Ace, King, Queen, Jack, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2. <br><br>The player who draws the highest card of all would be designated the first dealer. <br><br>The dealer shuffles the cards and deals the hand. He deals out 13 card hands around the table. <br><br>Game is split into two modes:<br><br>Hide Mode- The player to the dealer’s right selects a card placing it to table face down which will be declared as trump suit for that play.<br><br>Cut Mode- Play begins without choosing trump suit when the player is unable to follow the suit then whichever he/she chooses becomes the trump of the deal.<br><br>Thus, once a trump suit is designated for the hand, the highest card of the trump suit played to the trick wins the trick. If no trump card has been played to the trick, the highest card of the suit led wins the trick. The winner of each trick leads the first card to the next trick.

"cards.pyramid.solitaire"	"Pyramid Solitaire"	"500"	"4.3"	"<div jsname=""sngebd"">Pyramid Solitaire is one of the best-known and well-loved Solitaire or Patience card gamed. It's easy to learn, but difficult to win, and offers plenty of room for skilful play. As you play the game more, you'll find that there is more to it than appears at first glance.<br><br>The object of the game is to remove pairs of cards that add up to the total of the highest card in the deck from a pyramid arrangement of 28 cards.<br><br>It is a fun card game where you remove cards that add up to 13. It has a very distinctive layout (in the shape of a pyramid), and plays quite differently to standard solitaire.<br><br>Pyramid Solitaire is played with deck of 52 cards (with no jokers). To set up the pyramid, one card is dealt face up at the top of the playing area, then two cards beneath and partially covering it, then three beneath them, and so on completing with a row of seven cards for a total of 28 cards dealt. The remaining cards are placed to the side face down. This is the Draw Pile.<br><br>Only cards that are not covered by another card can be tapped. If you get stuck, try using the face-up card in the Draw Pile.<br><br>The game ends when all of the cards have been removed from the pyramid or when the draw pile has been exhausted, whichever happens first. <br><br>Pyramid Solitaire will take you deep into the pyramid, and will show you the classic card game that has astounded many players before you. Will you manage to clear the pyramid?<br><br>Solitaire is sometimes called ‘Patience’. <br><br>If you love playing patience card games, it’s a safe bet you will like pyramid solitaire. Patience games are simple, and you require nothing but a deck of standard playing cards. No wonder they’re so popular!<br><br>Pyramid Solitaire is a deceptively tricky solitaire card game and can be quite hard sometimes. <br><br>Solitaire trains concentration, visual memory, and strategic thinking.<br><br>Can you manage to reach the top of the pyramid in this fun variation on Patience?<br><br>Spare yourself the hassle of shuffling and dealing and play your favourite solitaire game for free!<br><br>The game offers a superb gameplay, in which you can relax, unwind and have fun after a long day.<br><br>Play Pyramid Solitaire and see if your skills stand the test of time. <br><br>Download it today!!<br><br>★★★★ Pyramid Solitaire Features ★★★★<br><br>✔ Splendid, stylish design <br>✔ Unlimited free Hints<br>✔ Unlimited free Undo<br>✔ Simple controls and smooth gameplay.<br>✔ Rules of the game explained in great detail in the ‘Help’ section.<br><br>If you’re enjoying the game Pyramid Solitaire, please take a few seconds to give us a review!<br><br>We would be very grateful for any feedback.<br><br>Enjoy Playing!</div>"	"0.00"	"Card"	"6"

It is played with two decks of 52 cards. The object of the game is to ""beat the dealer"", which can be done in a number of ways:<br><br>Get 21 points on the player's first two cards (called a blackjack), without a dealer blackjack;<br>Reach a final score higher than the dealer without exceeding 21; or<br>Let the dealer draw additional cards until his or her hand exceeds 21.<br>The player or players are dealt an initial two-card hand and add together the value of their cards. Face cards (kings, queens, and jacks) are counted as ten points. A player and the dealer can count his or her own ace as 1 point or 11 points. All other cards are counted as the numeric value shown on the card. After receiving their initial two cards, players have the option of getting a ""hit"", or taking an additional card. In a given round, the player or the dealer wins by having a score of 21 or by having the highest score that is less than 21. Scoring higher than 21 (called ""busting"" or ""going bust"") results in a loss. A player may win by having any final score equal to or less than 21 if the dealer busts.</div>"	"0.00"	"Card"	"76"

The highest card of the led suit will capture the hand, but if the led suit was broken by spade(s), then in this case highest ranked card of spade will capture the hand.

It is an exciting mix of strategy, luck and skill. <br><br>Canasta, and its variations, appeals to card players of all skill levels. The gameplay is fast and is full of exciting twists. The rules are intricate but not difficult to follow. Infact, the accuracy of play demanded by the rules adds drama to the game.<br><br>Canasta in spanish means ""Basket"".<br><br>The principal objective of canasta is to form melds - combinations of three or more cards of the same rank - with or without the help of wild cards. (Sequences are not valid melds).<br><br>Canasta is a card game of the rummy family of games believed to be a variant of 500 Rum. Although many variations exist for two, three, five or six players, it is most commonly played by four in two partnerships with two standard decks of cards. Players attempt to make melds of seven cards of the same rank and ""go out"" by playing all cards in their hand. <br><br>Canasta for two players is the same as four-handed Canasta, in a two player game, each player plays for himself.<br><br>Canasta uses two complete decks of 52 playing cards (French Deck) plus the four Jokers. All the Jokers and twos are wild cards.<br><br>The initial dealer in canasta is chosen by any common method, although it should be remembered that there is no privilege or advantage to being the dealer. The dealer shuffles the pack, the player to the dealer's right cuts, and the dealer deals out 2 hands of 11 cards to each player.The remaining cards are left in a stack in the center of the table.<br><br>The player to the dealer's left has the first turn, and play then proceeds clockwise. A turn begins either by drawing the first card from the stock into the player's hand or by picking up the entire discard pile. If the card drawn from the stock is a red three, the player must play it immediately and draw another card.<br><br>A player ""goes out"" when no cards are left after a meld or discard. A player is not permitted to go out, however, unless there's at least one canasta.<br>In the game of canasta a meld comprising seven or more cards, including at least four natural cards (called a ""base""), is a canasta. The side that first reaches a total of 5,000 wins a game.<br><br>Regardless of whether you’re a seasoned Canasta player or giving it a go for the first time, If you like card games, you’ll love Canasta!<br>And now you can play Canasta for free whenever and wherever you wish! <br><br>Download Canasta for Free today!<br>You're gonna love it!!<br><br>❖❖❖❖ Canasta Features ❖❖❖❖<br><br>✔✔ Fully optimised to run smoothly on your device<br>✔✔ Beautiful and easy to use interface<br>✔✔ Touch friendly interface <br>✔✔ Excellent game graphics<br>✔✔ Compatible for both Tablet and Phone<br><br>Download Canasta for your phone and tablets today and have endless hours of fun.<br><br>For any kind of Canasta support,visit:<br><br>http://droidveda.com<br><br>Please don't forget to Rate and Review Canasta!

This is how scoring is done in rummy 500, the sets and sequences are tabulated according to the values of each card.<br>• Game play consists of drawing a card to start your turn and discarding to end the turn.<br>• There is a third choice during the turn and this is to lay down a meld or add to a meld someone else has made. This second move is referred to as building.<br>• The jokers are considered “wild” cards and can be used as any other card in a set or sequence.<br>• You can pick up one or several of the discarded cards but you have to use the last one played.<br>• When taking cards from the discard pile you have to use it immediately to form a meld or the move is invalid.<br>• All of the royalty cards are worth 10 points, the ace can be valued at 11 points depending on its value place in a meld and it is 15 penalty points if you get caught with it. The Joker counts as the value of the card it replaces and adds 15 penalty points.<br>• Each game is made up of a series of rounds.<br>• The score from each round is added in succession.

The deal and play are counter-clockwise.<br><br>The aim of the game is to capture cards worth points from a layout on the table (also known as the floor). The game ends when one team has accumulated a lead of at least 100 points over the other team (this is called a baazi).<br><br>At the end of the play the scoring value of the captured cards is counted:<br><br>*All cards of the Spade suit have point values corresponding to their capture value (from the king, worth 13, down to the ace, worth 1).<br>*The aces of the other three suits are also worth 1 point each.<br>*The ten of diamonds is worth 6 points.<br><br>Only these 17 cards have a scoring value - all other captured cards are worthless. The total scoring value of all the cards in the pack is 100 points.<br><br><b>Sweeps</b><br>A sweep (or seep) occurs when a player picks up all the remaining cards on the floor in one go. Normally, the player's team is awarded a bonus of 50 points for a sweep, but there are two exceptions.<br><br>If on the very first turn of a deal the bidder uses the bid card to pick up all four of the initial floor cards, this sweep is worth only 25 points.<br>A sweep on the very last turn of a deal, using the dealer's last card, does not score any points.<br>When a sweep is made, the card used to make the sweep is normally stored face up in the team's pile of captured cards, as a means of remembering when adding up the scores how many sweeps have been made.<br><br>A sweep in the middle of a game is particularly dangerous. The next player has to throw a loose card, and if the following player can match it, that is another sweep for the same team. If this pattern continues, the team making the sweep will probably win the baazi on that deal.</div>"	"0.00"	"Card"	"437"

The cards in each suit rank: Ace 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Jack Queen King. An Ace is worth 1 point, Jacks, Queens and Kings are worth 10 points each, and all other cards count their face value.<br><br><b>Objective</b><br>The object of the game is, by drawing and discarding, to form sets and runs, and to to minimize the count of unmatched cards remaining in your hand.<br><br>A run consists of three or more consecutive cards of the same suit, such as ♥4, ♥5, ♥6 or ♠8, ♠9, ♠10, ♠J. (A-K-Q of a suit is not a run since aces are low in this game).<br><br>A set consists of three or four cards of the same rank, such as ♥7, ♣7, ♦7. A card can belong to only one combination at a time - you cannot use the same card as part of both a set and a run.<br><br><b>The Deal</b><br>The first dealer is chosen randomly. Thereafter the dealer is the winner of the previous hand. The cards are dealt one at a time counterclockwise, starting with the dealer: thirteen cards to the dealer and twelve cards to each of the other players. The remainder of the deck is placed face down to form the stock.<br><br><b>The Play</b><br>Each turn consists of the following:<br><br><b>Draw</b> You must begin by taking one card from either the top of the stock or the top card on the discard pile, and adding it to your hand. You may only take a card from the discard pile if you are able to create a meld (a set or run) with it, and you are then obliged to expose the meld.<br><b>Exposing Melds</b> If you have a valid meld or melds (sets or runs) in your hand you can expose any of them on the table in front of you. Melding is optional if a card was taken from the stock; you are not obliged to expose a meld just because you can, and note that melds held in hand do not count against you at the end of the play. A player must lay at least one meld on the table for the hand to be considered opened. In the special case that you can meld a set of four and you have not drawn from the discard pile to complete the meld, you can lay the set of four down face down. By doing this you can ""open"" your hand without losing the bonus payments for a secret set of 4 and without revealing the cards to the other players.<br><b>Laying off</b> (sapaw) This is also optional. If you wish, you may add cards to sets or runs previously melded by yourself or others. There is no limit to the number of cards a player may lay off in one turn. A player need not have opened their hand to lay off. Laying a card off on another player's exposed meld prevents that player from calling Draw on his or her next turn.<br><b>Discard</b> At the end of your turn, one card must be discarded from your hand and placed on top of the discard pile face up.</div>"	"0.00"	"Card"	"2821"

The game in Ultimate RummyCircle is played between 2 to 5 players.<br>2.	The game uses two standard decks of 52 cards each. <br>3.	Each player will be dealt 13 cards at the beginning of every Ultimate RummyCircle game.<br>4.	To win the game, you need to arrange the available cards into valid sequences or sets.<br>5.	You can create a sequence by placing 3+ running cards. These cards, however, should be of the same suit. For example, you can create a sequence like 5 ♥ 6 ♥ 7 ♥.<br>6.	You can create a set by combining 3+ cards of same face value, but different suits. An example is 3 ♥ 3 ♠ 3 ♣.<br>7.	A Joker card is selected at the start of every game. It can be used in place of any other card. That is, if you don’t have a card in 3 ♥ 3 ♠ 3 ♣, Joker can be used in that place.<br>8.	One or more Jokers can be used for completing sequences and sets<br>9.	You create a Pure Sequence if there is no Joker card is used.

It will either take 26 points away or add 26 points to all your opponents.

Whoever plays the highest card of the suit that started the trick collects the trick. The value of the cards grows in this order 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, King and Ace.<br>✓ 13 cards are dealt to each player. Before every hand, each player has to choose 3 cards and pass them to another player with one exception. For every fourth hand no cards are passed. The player holding the 2♣ of clubs must lead to begin the first trick.<br>✓ Players must follow suit. If you don't have a card of the suit which started the trick you can place any card.<br>✓ Players can start tricks with a card from any suit, with one exception: the cards of hearts. Placing a card of hearts in the trick for the first time is called breaking the hearts. Once the hearts are broken you can start a trick with a card of hearts.<br>✓ Sometimes you can collect all the scoring cards and thus you shoot the moon. In most cases you will receive 0 points and the others will each receive 26 points.<br>✓ However, if by adding 26 points to other players they gain more than 100 points, but you still lose, another solution is preferred. In this case 26 points will be subtracted from your score and all the other players will keep their scores.<br>✓ By default the set difficulty is easy. But you can change it from the main menu. To enter the main menu and to also pause the game just press on the button in the top left corner of the screen. You can change it from easy to medium, from medium to hard or from hard to easy.

If he takes one or more tricks, the team will lose 100 points.<br>✓ The value of the cards grows in this order: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, King and Ace. <br>✓ Players must follow suit. If you don't have a card of the suit which started the trick, you can place any card.<br>✓ Spades are always trump. You can only play a card of spades if you cannot follow suit. Once a card of spades is played it is said that the spades are broken. After this moment you can start a trick by playing a card of spades.<br>✓ If the cards in the trick are not spades, the card that follows suit and has the biggest value wins the trick. If cards of spades are played, then the highest card of spades wins the trick. <br><br><br><b>★ Support and Feedback</b><br>If you have any technical problems, please email us directly at support@gsoftteam.com.

CallBreak is a popular card game in Nepal and India that is now available on Google Play Store.  This game is a brain teaser: it will provide tons of mental exercise while providing hours of entertainment and fun.  You can also play another popular game, Jutpatti, through our app. This game requires quick thinking and is equally as entertaining and fun.<br><br>CALLBREAK<br>The origins of CallBreak is unknown, but many believe it is derived from the trick-based game Spades.  CallBreak (also known as Lakdi/Lakadi) is a popular card game in Nepal and India.  In CallBreak the term ""hand"" is used instead of trick, and ""call"" is used instead of bid. After each deal, each player has to make a call for the number of hands he/she can capture, and the objective is to capture at least that many hands in a round and try to break another player, i.e., stop them from getting their call.<br><br>Deal &amp; Call<br>CallBreak is a four-player card game with the spade as the trump card.  CallBreak uses a standard 52-card deck.  There are five rounds of play (deals) in a game.  The first dealer is chosen randomly, and then cards are dealt counterclockwise from the first dealer. Each player gets 13 cards, and then the game begins with each player calling their possible winning hands.  The first player to place a call is the player left of the dealer.  After the first player places their call, calls are made in a counterclockwise rotation until all four players have placed their calls.<br><br>Game Play<br>After the calls are placed, the player next to the dealer makes the first move.  The first player throws any card, but the suit thrown by the first player will be the lead suit.  The other three players must follow the same suit.  If the remaining players do not have this suit at all, they must break this by the trump card (which is the spade card of any rank).  If they do not have a spade of any rank, they can throw any other card out.  The highest card of the lead suit wins the hand, but if the lead suit was broken by spade(s), then the highest ranked spade card will capture the hand.  The winner of the hand leads the next hand.  This continues for 13 hands after which the next deal begins.<br><br>Points<br>After each round, each player gets a points update.  If a player captures at least as many hands as his/her calls, the player receives a point for each hand. If the player captures extra hands, he/she receives one-tenth of a point (0.10) for each extra hand.  For example, if a player places a bet for three calls and captures four hands, he/she will be given 3.1 points.  However, if a player does not capture at least as many hands as his/her calls, the player receives a negative point for each hand.  For example, if a player places a bet for four calls and captures two hands, he/she will be given -2 points.  <br><br>Result<br>At the end of the fifth round, the player with the highest points wins the game.<br><br>JUTPATTI<br>Jutpatti ((जुटपत्ती) is one of the easiest games you will ever play and is probably the first game people learn to play in Nepal and India.<br><br>The rules are simple.  Jutpatti is a card game that is played with an odd number of cards (5, 7, 9, 11).  After each player is dealt the required number of cards in a hand, the top card of the remaining deck determines the ‘joker.’  Each player now has to make card pairs so that each pair equals the ‘joker’ number.  Until the pairs are made, players throw out cards, fetch cards from the deck or grab cards thrown out by other players.  The player who can make all of their cards into pairs first wins the game.<br><br>JOIN US<br>Join the growing community of CallBreak and Jutpatti players.

Kartlarla oynanan bu oyun kısmen 51-101 e benzemektedir.Oyunda en kısa zamanda elindeki kartları bitirmek esas amaçtır.Yanık oyunu 2 adet 52'lik iskambil kağıdı ve 2 jokerle oynanır. Oynanışı 101 e çok benzer.<br><br>Yanık oyununda oyunculara 10 kart dağıtılır. Oyuna ilk başlayacak oyuncuya ise fazladan bir kart daha verilir ve bu oyuncu kart çekmeden ilk eli oynar.<br><br>Oyun sırası size geldiğinde yerden kart çekebilir veya yandan atılan kartı alabilirsiniz. Yandan kart aldığınızda el açmak zorunda değilsiniz. Kart çekmek için kartı tutup elinize götürünüz. Yerdeki kartıda tutup elinize götürüp bırakınız. Aynı şekilde kart atmak için de elinizdeki kartı yerdeki kartın üzerine tutup götürünüz.<br><br>Yanık oyununda henüz seri açılmamış ise elinizi açabilmek için elinizde en az 2 seri(2,3,4 ve 10,J,Q,K gibi) olmalıdır.<br>Eğer yere bir oyuncu el açmış ise diğer oyuncular ellerindeki kartları yerdeki karta işleyebilir böylece ellerindeki puanları azaltmış olurlar.

"com.jandsgame.freecellclassics"	"FreeCell Solitaire Classic"	"100000"	"4.4"	"<div jsname=""sngebd"">FreeCell is an open solitaire, where all cards are dealt face up. The board consists of four free cells, four home cells and eight columns. The goal is to place all 52 cards in the home cells, forming four stacks, one for each suit, in ascending order from ace to king. Moves to a column must be made in descending order, alternating colors. Only the cards at the bottom of the columns or in the free cells can be moved. A free cell can contain no more than one card at a time.<br><br>FreeCell Solitaire adds a new element of strategy to the classic solitaire games Klondike. After dealing from a standard deck of 52 cards, use the four free cell spots as placeholders as you try to move all of the cards from the Foundation stacks for a win. Just like Klondike solitaire games, you must move cards from the Tableau to the Foundation cells by suit, in ascending order. Most FreeCell games can be solved, if you can find the right strategy.<br><br>We respects your privacy!

Dealing and playing are counter-clockwise. Each player's mission is to meld all his cards or add cards to existing melds.<br><br>Cards and Dealing<br><br>Each player is dealt 14 cards, an extra card is dealt to the player on the dealer's right, and the rest of the cards are placed facing-down in the center of the table, this pile is called the stock pile.<br><br>Play<br><br>* The player who has 15 cards starts the game by discarding a card to the ""discarded pile"" in the middle of the table. The turn then passes anti-clockwise, each player having the option to either draw a card from the stock pile, or pick the last card from the discarded pile. In both cases each player should discard a card to the discarded pile to indicate the end of their turn.<br><br>* If the player decided to pick a card from the discarded pile, they are obliged to meld using this card before discarding another card (see the ""Melding and Adding Cards to Existing Melds"" section below).<br><br>* The round ends when one player melds all their cards. Each game consists of 5 rounds.<br>Melding and Adding Cards to Existing Melds<br><br>* The player is allowed to make the following melds: sequential cards of the same suit, or the different suits of the same card. A meld has to have a minimum of 3 cards and a maximum of 5. A Joker can be used as a wildcard to replace any card the player doesn't have.<br><br>* The sum of cards in a player's meld must be at least 51 when melding for the first time. After the first meld, the player can meld with no restrictions.<br><br>* After the first meld, the player can also add cards to existing melds freely.<br><br>* If a sequential meld contains a Joker, and one of the players holds the card the Joker is used to replace, the player is allowed to take the Joker in exchange for that card. In the case of a Joker and 2 cards of the same ranks and different suits, the Joker is considered a replacement for the 2 other cards and a player needs to have those cards to get the Joker.<br><br>* When calculating the sum of melds, a Joker is equivalent to the card it replaces and an ace is equivalent to 11, unless used in a series of A-2-3, in which case it is equivalent to 1.<br><br>Scoring<br><br>* The winner of the round is the first player who's out of cards and is given a score of -30, the rest of the players have their cards added to their score (11 for each Ace, 15 for each Joker, and 10 for each J, Q, or K). 100 points are added to the score of any players who did not meld.<br><br>* If a player melds all of their cards without adding any card to existing melds, this is considered a ""hand"" and is calculated as -60. Players get double the value of their cards and 200 points are added to the score of any players who did not meld.<br><br>* The winner of the game is the player with the lowest score at the end of the 5 rounds.<br><br>Other Types of Hand<br><br>* Hand Partner<br><br>* Hand Saudi</div>"	"0.00"	"Card"	"2164"

The lowest bid is 7 and the highest is 13, and they represent the number of tricks that the bidder's team thinks they can take. Each bid must be higher than the last, and a player who does not wish to bid at their turn can pass. Once you pass you are out of the bidding for the current round, and the bidding continues around the table as many times as necessary until it settles on the highest bidder.<br><br>-Play<br><br>The final bidder with the highest bid announces the trump suit (tarneeb) and leads the first trick and players must follow suit. Each trick is won by the highest card and the winner of each trick leads the next.<br>Players unable to follow it have the option to use ""trump"" cards, which are considered the highest among other cards. The winner of the trick is the player who uses a trump, unless a higher trump is used.<br>Round ends when players are out of cards.<br><br>-Scoring<br><br>The bidding team must take at least the number of tricks they bid.<br>The bidding team wins the round if they get the number of tricks they bid or more, the other team scores nothing in this case.<br>If the bidding team takes fewer tricks than they bid, they lose the amount of their bid from the total score, and the other team scores the number of tricks they took.<br>If the bidding team takes all 13 tricks, they score 16 points if they didn't originally bid 13, and 26 points if they did.<br>If the bidding team bids 13 and fails to take them, they score -16 and the other team scores the number of tricks they won.<br>The game ends when one of the teams wins by achieving a total score of 31 points or more.</div>"	"0.00"	"Card"	"1885"

If you are playing with jokers, you use them as wild cards and give each draw pile 16 cards. A stack of five cards, placed face down on each side between the players, serves as a replacement pile. Finally, two cards are placed face down in the center between the replacement piles.<br><br>-You may play a card in your hand by discarding it in the ""Play Pile"" if the card is 1 number/value higher or lower it is a match. (e.g. 5 can be played on a 6 or 4, a Queen can be played on a King or Jack)<br><br>-A 2 may be played on an Ace and a Ace may be played on a 2.<br><br>-You may have up to 5 cards in your hand at a single time. When you have less than 5 cards in your hand you may draw from your ""Draw Pile""<br><br>-First player to play all of his/her cards wins!<br><br>The rules are based of the wiki site: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_(card_game)<br><br><br>Created By <br><br>Jimmy Dickinson</div>"	"0.00"	"Card"	"11919"

After shuffling, seven piles of cards are laid from left to right. Each pile begins with one upturned card. From left to right, each pile contains one more card than the last. The first and left-most pile contains a single upturned card, the second pile contains two cards (one downturned, one upturned), the third contains three (two downturned, one upturned), and so on, until the seventh pile which contains seven cards (six downturned, one upturned). The piles should look like the figure to the right at the beginning of every game.<br><br>The four foundations (light rectangles in the upper right of the figure) are built up by suit from Ace (low in this game) to King, and the tableau piles can be built down by alternate colors, and partial or complete piles can be moved if they are built down by alternate colors also. Any empty piles can be filled with a King or a pile of cards with a King. The aim of the game is to build up a stack of cards starting with two and ending with King, all of the same suit. Once this is accomplished, the goal is to move this to a foundation, where the player has previously placed the Ace of that suit. Once the player has done this, they will have ""finished"" that suit, the goal being to finish all suits, at which time the player would have won. There are different ways of dealing the remainder of the deck:<br><br>Turning only one card at a time, but placing no limit on passes through the deck.<br>Turning three cards at once to the waste with no limit on passes through the deck, but allowing the player to switch once to a single pass through the deck one card at a time; after that single pass, however, the player cannot go back to turning three cards at a time and can turn over no more cards from the waste.</div>"	"0.00"	"Card"	"4222"

The vintage game of cards features 4 players with 13 cards each to offer virtual gaming experience. There will be five deals/round in a game. Starting a game with a bid/call, a player can compete against 3 computer players with effective artificial intelligence. Initiating a game by throwing a single card of any suit (club,diamond,heart,spade), the other players also follow the same suit unless they runs out of that particular suit. Absence of identical suit allows player to throw a card of another suit and the current round is won by highest card. Spade cards can be used to conquer other cards when no more cards of the same suit are there to offer.e.g. 2 of spade can conquer any higher cards of other suits. If all the players run out of both identical led suit and Spades card then the led card wins regardless of any suit.

Very fun and easy to play.<br>9. Great option for time pass.<br><br>Spades is a trick-taking card game devised in the United States in the 1930s. It can be played as either a partnership or solo/""cutthroat"" game. The object is to take at least the number of tricks (also known as ""books"") that were bid before play of the hand began. Spades are always trump. Other suits have no intrinsic value during play, but a card of the suit led in the current trick will beat a card of any other suit except a Spade. Rank of suit: Highest to lowest: Ace, King, Queen, Jack, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2.<br><br>Bidding:<br>Each player bids the number of tricks he expects to take. The player to the left of the dealer starts the bidding and bidding continues in a clockwise direction, ending with the dealer. As Spades are always trump, no trump suit is named during bidding as with some other variants. A bid of ""zero"" is called ""nil""; the player must bid at least one if you don't want to bid ""nil”.<br>In partnership Spades, the standard rule is that the bids by each member of the partnership are added together.<br><br>Blind and Nil Bidding:<br>Two very common variants of bidding are for a player or partnership to bid ""blind"", without having looked at their cards, or to bid ""nil"", stating that they will not take a single trick during play of the hand. These bids give the partnership a bonus if the player exactly meets their bid, but penalizes them if the players takes more or fewer.<br><br>Scoring:<br>Once a hand is completed, the players count the number of tricks they took and, in the case of partnerships or teams, the members' trick counts are summed to form a team count. Each player's or team's trick count is then compared to their contract. If the player or team made at least the number of tricks bid, 10 points for each bid trick are awarded (a bid of 5 would earn 50 points if made). If a team did not make their contract, they were ""set"", 10 points for each bid trick are deducted from the team's score (e.g.: six bid and any number less than six taken results in minus 60 points).<br>If a player/team took more tricks than they bid, a single point is scored for each overt rick, called an ""overt rick"", ""bag"" or ""sandbag"" (a bid of 5 tricks with 6 tricks taken results in a score of 51 points).<br><br>♦♦♦ Permissions requested and how they are used ♦♦♦<br>• android.permission.INTERNET: This permission is used to allow ad networks that advertise within the app.<br>android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE: This permission is used primarily to check for a network connection before attempting to show advertise within the app.</div>"	"0.00"	"Card"	"618"

It is also known as Bacon in other English-speaking countries. The object of the game is for a partnership to win at least three tricks. If the side that selected trump fails to get three tricks, it is said to be “euchred”. Winning all five tricks is called a “march”.<br><br>Paired up into teams of two, each player receives 5 cards. The trump suit is determined through a bidding phase before each round. The Makers are the partnership who selected the trump suit and must win more tricks than the Defenders. <br><br>Players are required to follow suit after the leading card has been played. The player who played the highest value card of the suit that was lead will collect the trick. Points are awarded after each round based on which partnership won more tricks.<br><br>When one or more cards of the trump suit are in a trick, the highest trump suit card will win the trick. The team who reaches 10 points first win the game.<br><br>EUCHRE TERMINOLOGY<br><br>• Bowers: the highest cards in the suit<br>• Defenders: the partnership that did not order the trump<br>• Euchre(d): when a player calls trump and fails to get three tricks<br>• Eldest Hand (AKA 1st Seat): opponent to the left of the dealer<br>• Hand: a hand consists of five tricks (when all cards from the deal have been played)<br>• Kitty: the four cards left over after the deal<br>• Makers: the partnership that ordered the trump<br>• March: calling and getting all five tricks<br>• Order Up: declaring the trump suit<br>• Pone (AKA 3rd Seat): the opponent to the right of the dealer<br>• Singleton: a lone card of any given suit, when no other cards of that suit are held in your hand<br>• Stick the Dealer: a game option that forces the dealer to declare the trump suit if all other players pass in the 2nd round of bidding<br>• Trick: all four cards played by each player<br>• Trump: the suit that outranks all other suits<br>• Turn-card (AKA Up-Card): the top card from the kitty which has been turned face up<br><br>TIPS<br><br>• Lead with a singleton off-suit whenever possible. If no other cards of that suit are in your hand, the probability of your opponents having them is higher which prevents them from trumping your ace. Your best shot for having an ace make it around the table and winning a trick is on the opening lead. <br>• Don’t always count on your partner for at least one trick. Doing so can end up backfiring and getting you euchred! <br>• Keep track of the cards played.

It is played with a standard set of 52 playing cards and is closely related to other trick-taking games like Spades and Euchre.<br> <br>The object of the game is to score the least amount of points. You earn points for every heart you take and if you are unlucky enough to get the Queen of Spades then you are stuck with an extra 13 points. In the default game mode in Simply Hearts, the game ends when someone reaches 50 points. However, that can be changed to 100 points, 150 points or it can be set to end after 1, 3 or 5 rounds of play.<br> <br>HEARTS TERMINOLOGY<br> <br>❤ Breaking Hearts: Hearts cannot lead a trick until a Heart has been discarded on a trick<br>❤ Discarding Cards: Players can discard any card if they are unable to play a card of the led suit<br>❤ First Trick: All penalty cards cannot be played on the first trick. This includes Hearts and the Queen of Spades<br>❤ Following Suit: Players must follow the suit of the first card played in each trick, if possible<br>❤ Hand: The cards held by one player<br>❤ Passing: Before each round, each player will pass three cards to another player. The direction of the cards passed will change each round<br>❤ Penalty Cards: Hearts are worth 1 point and the Queen of Spades is worth 13 points<br>❤ Shooting The Moon: When a player collects all Hearts and the Queen of Spades in a single round, they instead score zero and each opponent scores 26 points<br>❤ Trick: One card played from each player forms the trick<br>❤ Trick Winner: The player with the highest value card of the led suit collects each trick<br>❤ Voiding a Suit: When a player no longer has any cards of a specific suit, that suit is considered voided. This allows the player to play cards of other suits when that suit is led<br> <br>TIPS<br> <br>❤ Be careful when passing cards. You may help an opponent who is trying to shoot the moon if you pass all high ranking cards<br>❤ Keep track of cards that have been played! There are 13 cards of each suit in the deck.

A player can also win with a small class of special hands. There are fairly standard rules about how a piece is drawn, how a piece is robbed from another player, the use of simples (numbered tiles) and honors (winds and dragons), the kinds of melds allowed, how to deal the tiles and the order of play.

You are about to find out how Solitaire Tower was created!<br><br>One day, four time travellers walked into a bar. They were sipping their drinks and started talking about a game.<br><br>Shakespeare was the first one to speak: “To solitaire or not to solitaire? I would love a game in which the balcony is more like a tower and you keep climbing. Deny thy limits, refuse thy boredom.”<br><br>And then, Picasso added: “I'd want a game with colours that vibrate. I like my colours like I like my art: always mesmerizing.”<br><br>Sinatra stepped in and mentioned: “Tap dancing is fun and tapping on cards reminds me of good old times. And of course, seeing your results in an organised way, like leaderboards and statistics sure makes you sing cause it’s great to be a winner.”<br><br>Curie put her two Nobel Prizes down on the table and said: “I am a winner. I like magic. And I’d love to have a game in which you can mix things to perfection. Skills with patience. Passion with achievements.”<br><br>While our fellow travellers were talking, the bartender was taking valuable notes. Soon enough he had put together the ingredients creating the most unusual and original mix!<br><br>Take a look at the bartender’s recipe right here:<br><br>♠ Easy to understand gameplay<br>♠ Endless levels for you to explore<br>♠ Immersive and relaxing visuals <br>♠ Score multiplier <br>♠ Game statistics to keep track of your progress<br>♠ Leaderboards to see how your score stacks against other players<br><br>And if you want to be one of the great guys talking about our game, send the Bartender your feedback and he'll make sure the recipe always has what you want: community@mavenhut.com.</div>"	"0.00"	"Card"	"9495"

Вскрывается козырь. Ходить можно с одной карты, с двух или с трех карт одной масти. Если противник бьет карты хода, он забирает взятку себе. Если не может побить, сбрасывает любые карты (по количеству карт хода). После каждой взятки игроки добирают карты из колоды по одной карте друг после друга, до трех карт на руках. <br><br>БУРА<br>Выигрывает тот, кто первым наберет во взятках 31 очко. Комбинация из трех козырей на руках называется бура.

Usually, a sequel takes the solution to a problem and duplicates it. This is why our expectations of game sequels are often more-of-the-same-but-better. I'd rather see more sequels that brought a renewed level of surprise and novelty, and I'm hoping that's what you find in Flipflop Solitaire.<br><br>While Sage Solitaire was all about trying to capture the feeling of a tight, easy to play, tough to win, zen solitaire game, Flipflop Solitaire is about knots.<br><br>In a typical Solitaire game, like Klondike, you're taking a knot of cards and untying it into sequences. Then you reverse those sequences into clean ordered stacks.<br><br>In Flipflop you take your knot of cards and tie it into other, hopefully, better knots. Then you untie those knots into the final ordered stacks. Having so much control over the way your intermediary knots are constructed led to a lot more depth than I expected.<br><br>I hope you enjoy this game as much as I've enjoyed discovering it.<br><br><i>-zach</i></div>"	"0.00"	"Card"	"897"

During the game, eldest hand makes trumps after the first five cards have been dealt, and trick-play is typically stopped after one party has won seven tricks. A special bonus is awarded if one party wins the first seven tricks, or even all tricks.

Cards are dealt in batches of 5 – 4 – 4<br><br>The player who sits after the dealer in the direction of play (which is typically counter-clockwise) is known as trump-caller. Having received the first five cards, this player announces the trump suit (usually called rang of the game). The other players are not allowed to look at their cards before the trump suit has been announced. The trump-caller leads to the first trick. In trick-play the normal whist rules apply: Players must follow suit if possible, and the highest trump, or the highest card of the suit led, takes the trick. The winner of a trick leads to the next trick.<br><br>The party that wins seven or more tricks wins the hand[4] and will usually stop the game at this point.

"com.octro.bhabho"	"Bhabho - Laad - Get Away"	"100000"	"4.2"	"<div jsname=""sngebd""><b>Bhabho</b> is very addictive and popular <b>Indian Card Game.</b><br><br><b>Bhabho</b> is also known by many players as <b>Bhabhi</b> or <b>Laad</b> or <b>Get Away</b>. The aim of the game is to ""get away"" by playing all of one's cards. The last remaining player who fails to get away and is left holding cards is the loser.<br><br><br>First trick of <b>Bhabho - Laad - Get Away</b>:<br><br>The player who holds the Ace of Spades begins by playing it face up on the table, and each of the other players must play also a card face up. For convenience, this may be done in clockwise order, but in this first trick it is not strictly necessary for players to wait for their turn before playing. Those players who have a spade must play a spade of their choice; those who have no spades may play any card they wish. When everyone has played one card, these cards are gathered and set aside face down, beginning a waste pile. The player who had the Ace of Spades now begins the second trick by playing any one of his her remaining cards face up on the table. <br><br>Second and subsequent tricks of <b>Bhabho - Laad - Get Away</b>:<br><br>Each trick is begun by the player of the highest card in the suit that was led to the previous trick: this player is said to ""have the power"". The player leads any card, placing it face up on the table. Then the other players, in clockwise order, must if possible play a card of the same suit as the card that was led. If they have several cards of the suit they have a free choice which of them to play. A player who has no card of the suit led may play any card. This card of a different suit, sometimes known as a 'tochoo' or a 'thulla', and it ends the play to that trick. Subsequent players, to the left of the one who played the tochoo, do not get to play a card. <br><br>If everyone plays a card of the same suit as the card led by the first player, then when all have played one card, these cards are gathered and added face down to the waste pile. <br><br>If someone was unable to follow suit and played a tochoo, then whoever played the highest card of the suit that was led picks up all the cards played to the trick and adds them to their hand. In either case, the player who played the highest card of the suit that was led now ""has the power"" and begins the next trick by leading any card from hand. <br><br><b>Getting away</b><br><br>As the game continues, since not everyone plays to every trick and players sometimes have to pick up cards, the players will run out of cards at different times. Players who run out of cards have ""got away"": they take no more part in the play and are therefore safe from losing. <br><br>However, it is not possible to get away if you ""have the power"". If your last card is the highest in a trick in which everyone is able to follow suit, then it is your turn to lead to the next trick but you have no card. In this case you must draw a card at random from the (shuffled) face down waste pile, before the cards from the trick just played are thrown onto the pile.<br><br>You must lead the card that you drew to continue the game. If you are lucky, and a higher card of that suit is played to the trick, then you will be out of the game and safe. If no one plays higher in that suit then you will have to lead again, either from the cards you pick up if there is a tochoo, or otherwise by drawing from the waste pile again. <br><br>Taking cards Before any trick, any player is allowed to take all the cards from the player to their immediate left - or if that player has no cards, the next player in clockwise order who still has cards - and add these cards to their hand. The player whose cards were taken has got away and cannot lose. <br><br>At first sight it may seem surprising that anyone would wish to do this given that the aim is to get rid of cards. In fact it is often the best move if the player to your left does not have the suits that you have, or has some low cards that you need.</div>"	"0.00"	"Card"	"519"

It can be played as either a partnership or solo/""cutthroat"" game. The object is to take at least the number of tricks (also known as ""books"") that were bid before play of the hand began. Call Bridge is a descendant of the Whist family of card games, which also includes Bridge, Hearts, and Oh Hell. Its major difference as compared to other Whist variants is that, instead of trump being decided by the highest bidder or at random, the Spade suit is always trumps, hence the name.<br><br>Call Bridge is a game that is both enjoyable and challenging since it requires one to look for strategies and ways in order to win. This is considered one of the most challenging card games of all time and this is mainly because it is usually played with a partner and one does not know the cards that the partner is holding. This makes it extremely difficult to win more so if there is no connection between the two and if one of them does not have the tips for playing spades.

Special auxiliary functions can also assist you to play this game.It's really awesome,download and enjoy it for free now !!!<br><br>       Mahjong is a game that entails four players. At the start of the game, a player is the dealer. The meaning of the dealer lies in that he can have 14 tiles, while other players can only have 13 ones.The game is over after each of the four players has acted as the dealer in turn for four times.<br>     The purpose of Mahjong is to gather together four sequences or triplets with 14 tiles, plus a couple of pairs (few special points are not composed of sequences and triplets, see the introduction about points below). Each sequence or triplet is composed of three tiles, while the pair of two same tiles. The so-called sequence consists of three tiles of consecutive numbers, such as Character Three, Character Four and Character Five, while the so-called triplet of three same tiles. The one that first gathers together four sequences or triplets and a couple of pairs (or special points) wins. The other three must give the winner money in different amounts according to points.<br>        At the start of the game, the dealer discards the most useless tile, while all other three players are entitled to have the discarded tile. The dealer’s opponent on the right (player on the right) has the right to chow, pong or kong that tile, while the other two players can only pong or kong it. To chow means that if you want to gather together a sequence, and you already have two tiles of the sequence, for example, you already have Bamboo Four and Bamboo Five, while your opponent on the left happens to discard Bamboo Three, you can chow it to gather together a sequence. To pong means that if you want to gather together a triplet, and you already have two tiles of the triplet, for instance, you have had two tiles of Dot Nine, you can pong if anyone discards Dot Nine. To kong means that if you already have a closed triplet, say, you already have three tiles of Character Five, you can kong if anyone discards Character Five. If the players want to chow, pong and kong at the same time, the one wanting to pong or kong has the priority. Anyone that chows, pongs or kongs must expose the tiles chowed, ponged or konged without making any change. If one discards a tile, but nobody chows, pongs or kongs, the opponent on the right can withdraw a tile from the stack, which is called drawing. There is another situation of kong:if you have an triplet(exposed or closed), say, you already have three tiles of Dragon Green but you draw a tile of Dragon Green when drawing, you can also kong. The player konging tiles must withdraw a tile from the end of the stack. Of course, no matter whether you chow, pong or draw, you must discard a tile after the action to maintain 13 tiles.<br>      After the tiles in your hand are all useful and you only need the fourteenth one to win, and now you are in the stage of ready hand. For example, you have gathered together three sequences, a triplet and a tile of East Wind, you can declare a win if anyone discards or you self-draw a tile of East Wind (you have to gather together special tiles in case of winning special points). In many cases, you can wait for more than one necessary tile, which will grant you more opportunities to win. For example, if you have gathered together two sequences, a triplet and a couple of pairs, and there remains an incomplete sequence of Character Two and Character Three, you may wait for Character One or Character Four to win.</div>"	"0.00"	"Card"	"307"

"com.pokernight.app"	"WiFi Poker Room - Texas Holdem"	"100000"	"3.9"	"<div jsname=""sngebd"">WiFi Poker Room is Texas Holdem poker with friends around you over WiFi. No cards or chips? Tired of constant shuffling? This app does it for you! Organize a home game or play poker while travelling on the train or airplane! <br><br>This game is local multiplayer that can be played offline. You just need to be connected to the same WiFi network or hotspot. No need to register, just create a table, connect and play some poker!<br><br>WiFi Poker Room is a great replacement to traditional poker game with cards and chips. Not everyone owns chips and even though playing with real cards is fun - shuffling is not. With this app it takes just a second to shuffle and deal cards. Bet amounts, pots and winnings are all counted for you, no room to make a mistake. You cannot bet or fold out of turn which often happens in home games. In our experience, it makes home games about 3 to 4 times faster. Being card dead can ruin a poker evening. If you can play 80 hands in an hour instead of 20 you will have a much bigger chance to actually play some good poker.<br><br>Local multiplayer nature of the game allows you play with friends around you. Observing your opponents reactions is a big part of Texas Holdem poker. You may end up making a great call or a ridiculously good fold only because you saw your friends shaky hands. Online poker does not give you this opportunity.<br><br>Playing at home is fine but why not play on the move? This 4 hour car trip, or even longer flights, might be much more tolerable if you could enjoy some good poker. Make a hotspot out of your device and play completely offline. You don't need space, card or chips, just your phone and at least one more friend willing to play you.<br><br>Invite your friends over for a new kind of home game.<br><br>★★★ REAL POKER EXPERIENCE ★★★<br>Cards are dealt face down as in real life. You don't need to hide your phone. Put it in front of you and take a look when you're ready and no-one is watching. When you make a great bluff show a card or two, it can really tilt your opponents... Use gestures to check and fold! Poker players often knock on the table to check and slide their cards to fold. So can you!<br><br>★★★ OFFLINE MULTIPLAYER ★★★<br>This game is local multiplayer. You need at least 2 Android or iOS devices to play. Up to 10 supported! Connect to the same WiFi network and start a game at selected stakes. Your table will be visible only to other players on the local WiFi network.<br><br>★★★ NO INTERNET NEEDED ★★★<br>Playing offline multiplayer means you do not need to have internet connection to play. When you're travelling create a personal hotspot from your device. If you're worried about mobile data usage just disable it. No online logins or registration required.<br><br>★★★ FASTER GAMEPLAY ★★★<br>Texas Holdem is fun but shuffling cards and dealing takes a long time, especially when playing heads-up. Now it's just one press of a button! Tired of reminding your friends the action is on them? Their phones will vibrate when it's their turn to act. You can also poke them!<br><br>★★★ PLAY HISTORY ★★★<br>All hands you play are saved so you can analyze your play or search for weak spots in opponents play. <br><br>★★★ GAME SAVING ★★★<br>If you have to stop playing, but would like to continue later, don't worry because the game is already saved. When you create a table the game will be saved automatically during play. After reloading players' cards and stack sizes will be restored, and everyone will be able to reconnect to your table. This is a premium feature.<br><br>★★★ RECONNECT AND PLAY ★★★<br>If you happen to disconnect from the game, don't worry. You can connect again and continue where you left off.</div>"	"0.00"	"Card"	"739"

"com.pyramidsolitaire"	"Pyramid Solitaire"	"5000"	"4.6"	"<div jsname=""sngebd""><b>Pyramid Solitaire Rules</b><br><br><b>Objective</b><br>The objective in Pyramid Solitaire is to get rid of all the cards in the Pyramid. You get rid of cards by matching two cards whose ranks equal 13 together. Possible matches would be a 3 and a 10, 5 and an 8 etc. An ace ranks as 1, a Jack is 11, Queen is 12 and King is 13.<br><br><b>Gameplay</b><br>The game board in Pyramid solitaire is made up of four things:<br>	•	The Pyramid: The pyramid is made up of 28 cards, in 7 rows. Each card is partially covered by two cards from the next row.<br>	•	The Stock: The facedown pile on the bottom left. It is used to draw cards from and put on the Waste.<br>	•	The Waste: The faceup pile next to the Stock. Cards on the Waste can be matched to cards in the Pyramid to get rid of the Pyramid cards. E.g. you can tap a 4 from the Waste and open 9 on the Pyramid, and then both those cards will be moved to the Foundation, and are out of the game.<br>	•	The Foundation: The place where cards that have been removed from the Pyramid are put.<br>The purpose of the game is to match cards together so their ranks equal 13. The cards that are available are any card on the Pyramid that have no other cards covering them, and the top card on the Waste pile. In the beginning of the game all the cards in the bottom row of the Pyramid are available, then slowly the cards in the upper rows become available as you remove more of the cards in the lower rows.<br><br><b>Allowed Moves</b><br>	•	Flip cards from the Stock onto the Waste. You move cards from the Stock onto the Waste by tapping on the top card of the Stock.<br>	•	Move the top card of the Waste onto an open Pyramid card. You can first tap the Waste card and then tap the Pyramid card. The Pyramid card must be available for this to work, it can't be covered by any Pyramid card from a lower row.<br>	•	Move a Pyramid card onto another Pyramid card. Both the Pyramid cards must be available, not covered by any other card for this to work. First tap on one and then tap on the other.<br>	•	Reset the Stock once it's empty. Once you've flipped all the cards from the Stock onto the Waste you can tap on the RESET button where the Stock was, and it will put all the cards from the Waste back into the Stock. In this version you are allowed to reset the Stock as many times as you want.<br>	•	Move a King to the Foundation. The purpose is to move cards whose combined ranks equal 13 to the foundation. A King ranks as 13 by itself, so it can't be matched with any other card. To get rid of a King you can simply tap the card once.<br>	•	You can Undo as many times as you like. The game offers unlimited undos. Each Undo counts as a new move though, so if you're trying to win the game in as few moves as possible you should be careful about how many undos you use.<br><br><b>Winning</b><br>A game is considered won if all the cards from the Pyramid are removed. Not all games are winnable. The game will notify you if there's no chance of winning the game anymore.<br><br><b>Time and Moves</b><br>The game counts the moves you make, and measures the time it takes to finish the game, so you can compete against your previous best games. The best possible game would be if you never used the stock and always removed two cards at a time from the Pyramid (no kings), in that case your move count would be 14.<br><br><b>Variations</b><br>There are many variations of Pyramid Solitaire possible. In some you have more Waste piles, in others you never reset the Stock, some have the Stock face-up, and there are plenty of others as well. I've chosen this variation, please don't email me telling me it's ""wrong"" or leave bad rate, there are many possibilities, this is just the one I like the best :)</div>"	"0.00"	"Card"	"64"

You play with a standard deck of playing cards. Play consists of 2 phases.<br>        <br>Bidding Phase:<br>        <br>The bidding phase is where each player selects the number of tricks they think they are going to win in that hand. You select your bid by use of the bid buttons. The last player to bid cannot bid to make the total bids equal the number of cards in the hand. This is so that not all players are able to win as many tricks as bid. The number bid represents the exact number of tricks that player thinks they will win not the lowest number of tricks they think they will win.        		      <br>     <br>Play Phase:<br>        <br>The play phase starts with the player to dealer's left selecting any card from their hand. Each player then follows by playing a card of the same suit if possible with the highest card winning the trick. If a player has no cards of the same suit they may either discard an unwanted card or play a trump. <br>The trump suit is indicated in a box to the top-right of screen. <br>Trumps have the effect of beating the suit led and once one is played the highest trump wins the trick. <br>The trick winner then starts the next trick by again selecting any card from their hand. If ""NT"" is displayed in the Trumps area there are no trumps in this hand.<br>        		<br>Scoring:<br>        <br>After the hand is finished each player is given 1 point for every trick they won and an additional 10 points if they won as many tricks as they bid. <br>The score-sheet is displayed with the number of cards in the hand in the furthest left column and the players' scores so far in the remaining columns.<br><br>Romanian Whist:<br><br>Romanian whist is a variation on contract whist where only the top cards are used to make 8 per player e.g. 3 players only A,K,Q,J,10,9 are used. The number of cards in the hand starts at 1 and there is 1 round like this per player, then the number of cards increases by 1 each round to 8, then there is 1 round of 8 for each player. Lastly the number of cards decreases back to 1 and then there is 1 round again per player. In the long version cards start at 8, go to 1, then back to 8. Trumps are decided by turning the top card after the deal. If you have a trump and trumps are not led you must play the trump. If the number of cards is 8 then there are no trumps. Each player scores the number of tricks they bid plus 5 if they make the contract. If they miss the contract deduct 1 for each trick over or under. <br><br><br>Now with added multiplayer!</div>"	"0.00"	"Card"	"1869"

You can read rules of the game, in game help, or over the internet.<br><br>Rules:<br>In the basic game there are two players and you use a standard 52 card pack. Cards rank as usual from high to low: A K Q J T 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2. Suits are ignored in this game.<br>Deal out all the cards, so that each player has 26. Players do not look at their cards, but keep them in a packet face down. The object of the game is to win all the cards.<br>Both players now turn their top card face up and put them on the table. Whoever turned the higher card takes both cards and adds them (face down) to the bottom of their packet. Then both players turn up their next card and so on.<br>If the turned up cards are equal there is a war. The tied cards stay on the table and both players play the next three cards on the table. Whoever has the higher of the third cards wins the war and adds all eight cards face-down to the bottom of their packet. If the third cards are equal as well, the war continues: each player puts another three cards on the table. The war goes on like this as long as the face-up cards continue to be equal. As soon as they are different the player of the higher card wins all the cards in the war.<br>The game continues until one player has all the cards and wins. This can take a long time.<br>- In the last version are added 2 timed game modes. The game is played for 3 minutes, and the winner is the player who has more cards after the time is up.</div>"	"0.00"	"Card"	"181"

Only one player who has a higher combination and a card gets the points, others do not get any points. <br><br>The rules of range of rads are the following: <br>Any poltinnik (bullseye) is higher than tierce. When the combinations are equal the advantage has a higher card in the combination. When the combinations are equal the advantage has a trump combination. In case both combinations are not trump the combination is considered to be called by the player according to the order if dealing cards. <br><br>Bella cannot be called before the game starts: a player has a right to call it by saying “Bella”. <br><br>The Game: <br>In the course of the game players head tricks. The player sitting to the left leads his card first. The next player returns the pattern lead and puts his card on the card on the table, if without the suit – the trump, if without the suit and trump – any other card. The player whose card is higher takes the trick. There is one peculiarity. If the lead is made with a trump and the next player has a higher and a lower trump, he must lead a higher trump. <br><br>Calculation of points: <br>Players sump up the value of cards, contained in their tricks. <br><br>The value of cards: <br>seven, eight and nine (lay) – 0 points; <br>ace – 11 points; <br>ten – 10 points; <br>king – 4 points; <br>queen – 3 points; <br>knave (lay) – 2 points; <br>knave (trump) – 20 points; <br>nine (trump) – 14 points. <br><br>Last trick: <br>Bonuses for combinations and for the last trick (10 points) are added to the sum of card points. <br><br>Conditions of bonuses: <br>Points for triece and poltinnik (bullseye) are added if it took at least one even if empty card. Points for Bella are added in any case if it was called. The points got by players are written down in a table. <br><br>Bide: <br>In any dealing the player who declared the trump must take the highest amount of points. If he does not, he gets Bide which is marked as “B” in the table, and his opponent gets the points. The bides are summed up and after the second bide every next bide subtracts 100 points from the general score of the player. In case of a rare situation of the so called “eggs”, when the opponents get the same amount of points,the player's points are written down separately (the so called hanging bide). The one of the opponents gets the points who in the next dealing gets more points. <br><br>A ski: <br>In the absence of a trick, a player gets “a ski” and minus 50 points from his general score.</div>"	"0.00"	"Card"	"1929"

The scoring is also changed - only number of moves counted - the lower the score - the better.<br><br>Only the top (exposed) card of each tableau pile is available for play.

Any card may be moved into an empty space. Blocks of cards may not be moved, unless the requisite number of free cells and/or tableau spaces are available to allow each individual card to be moved. To move part of partial pile, drag whole pile - the game will self adjust.

The computer game was originally created by Brodie Lockard in 1981 and named Mah-Jongg after the game that uses the same tiles for play. Lockard claims that it was based on a centuries-old Chinese game called ""the Turtle"". However, it was not until Activision released Shanghai in 1986 for the Macintosh and Apple IIgs that the game gathered momentum. A version of this game was also included in the Microsoft Entertainment Pack for Windows 3.x in 1990 and went by the name Taipei. It was subsequently included in the Best of Windows Entertainment Pack. Premium editions of the Windows Vista operating system and Windows 7 include a version of the game known as Mahjong Titans.<br>As any other successful game, millions of clones have been created on all possible platforms.

It is a card-passing game where each player hopes not to end up with the odd card out—the Old Maid. Over the time however the simplicity of the game made it very popular with the kids age 5-10 years old. The game is played all over the world. It is known in Germany as Schwarzer Peter, in Sweden as Svarte Petter and in Finland as Musta Pekka (all meaning ""black Peter"") and in France as le pouilleux (""the lousy/louse-ridden one"") or vieux garçon (""old boy"").

"com.sg.js.Pyramid"	"Pyramid Solitaire"	"10000"	"3.7"	"<div jsname=""sngebd"">Your goal is to clear pyramid of cards by creating combinations of 2 cards that add up to 13. Pyramid Solitaire is played with a 52-card deck. First, 28 cards are dealt into a pyramid, starting with one card at the top. The pyramid has 7 rows, and the number of cards equals the row position. Each card covers the one on its upper left and upper right (if there are cards in those places). The remaining 24 cards are put in the draw pile. It is possible to put the top card from the draw pile to the discard pile(s), but not backwards. Only the top card of each pile and the exposed cards in the pyramid may be used to make matches. The remaining cards are placed to the side face down. This is the Stock. <br><br>To play, pairs of exposed cards can be removed to the Foundation if their values total 13. Aces count as 1, Jacks – 11, Queens – 12. Kings count as 13 and can be removed on their own. All other cards count at their face value. Cards must not be covered. Thus when an Ace rests on a Queen, that Queen can not be removed. While playing ""Temp Store"" mode, one card at a time however can be moved to temporary card store (next to stock) to increase your options. You may draw cards from the Stock one at a time and match it with any exposed card. <br><br>Each time the set is removed the score is increased. Once pyramid is cleared extra bonus is awarded.

The bids and tricks taken are combined for a partnership. Spades is a descendant of the Whist family of card games, which also includes Bridge, Hearts, and Oh, Hell. Its major difference as compared to other Whist variants is that, instead of trump being decided by the highest bidder or at random, the Spade suit is always trump, hence the name.<br><br><b>Spades overview</b><br>A standard pack of 52 cards is used ranked from highest to lowest: <br>A, K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2.<br>The four players are in fixed partnerships, with partners sitting opposite each other. The first dealer is chosen at random, and the turn to deal rotates clockwise. The cards are shuffled and dealt clockwise. <br><br>All four players bid a number of tricks. Each team adds together the bids - number of tricks that team must try to win in order to get a positive score. Everyone must bid a number. Players are not allowed to pass and bids once made cannot be altered. A bid of 0 tricks is known as Nil. This is a declaration that that the player who bid Nil will not win any tricks during the play. There is an extra bonus for this if it succeeds and a penalty if it fails. The partnership also has the objective of winning the number of tricks bid by the Nil's partner.<br><br>The player to dealer's left leads any card (except a spade). Each player, in turn, clockwise, must follow suit if able; if unable to follow suit, the player may play any card.<br>A trick containing a spade is won by the highest spade played; if no spade is played, the trick is won by the highest card of the suit led. The winner of each trick leads to the next. Spades may not be led until either some player has played a spade, or the leader has nothing but spades left in hand. <br><br>A side that takes at least as many tricks as its bid calls for receives a score equal to 10 times its bid. Additional tricks (bags) are worth an extra one point each.  A side which (over several deals) accumulates 10 or more bags has 100 points deducted from its score. Any bags beyond 10 are carried over to the next cycle. If a side does not make its bid, they lose 10 points for each trick they bid. If a bid of nil is successful, the nil bidder's side receives 100 points addition to the score won (or lost) by the partner of the nil bidder for tricks made. If a bid of nil fails - that is, the bidder takes at least one trick - the bidder's side loses 100 points, but still receives any amount scored for the partner's bid.<br>The usual rule is that when a nil fails, the tricks won by the nil bidder do not count towards making the partner's bid, but do count as bags for the team.

An early variant of Tic-tac-toe was played in Roman Empire, around the first century BC. It was called Terni Lapilli and instead of having any number of pieces, each player only had three, thus they had to move them around to empty spaces to keep playing. The game's grid markings have been found chalked all over Rome. However, there is some evidence to suggest that Tic-Tac-Toe could originate back to ancient Egypt.<br>The different names of the game are more recent. The first print reference to ""noughts and crosses"", the British name, appeared in 1864. The first print reference to a game called ""tick-tack-toe"" occurred in 1884, but referred to ""a children's game played on a slate, consisting in trying with the eyes shut to bring the pencil down on one of the numbers of a set, the number hit being scored"". ""Tic-tac-toe"" may also derive from ""tick-tack"", the name of an old version of backgammon first described in 1558. The U.S. renaming of noughts and crosses as tic-tac-toe occurred in the 20th century.<br>In 1952, Tic-tac-toe became the first known video game, OXO (or Noughts and Crosses) for the EDSAC computer. The computer player could play perfect games of tic-tac-toe against a human opponent.<br>When playing against a phone, human player is always 'O'.

The suit of this card is considered to be trump till the end of current game.<br><br>The goal of game is to take «tricks».

Thus, none of other players knows which cards were dropped. Player, who have beated cards of others, wins the trick.<br><br>The priority of cards of the same suit is defined as follows: 6, 7, 8, 9, Jack, Queen, King, 10, Ace. Any card of a trump suit has higher priority than any card of another suit. Two cards of different suits (not trump cards) can't be compared. For example: card «9 Hearts» is greater than card «7 Hearts»; card «10 Clubs» is greater than card «Queen Clubs»; if Hearts is trump, then card «6 Hearts» is greater than card «Ace Spades», while cards «Ace Spades» and «10 Diamonds» can't be compared.<br><br>Any player has the right to go out of turn with 4 cards of the same suit («molodka»), even if previous players have already made a move. In this case, cards from table should be returned back to players and the drawing of trick continues according to usual rules. If two players collected the molodka simultaneously, the right of the first turn belongs to player who is closer to player, who initially performed first turn.<br><br>After the drawing of trick, the player, who win the trick, should collect cards and put them into the heap of tricks of his team. After that, all players take cards from deck until each player has 4 cards in his hand. Each player takes 1 card from the top of deck in the clockwise order.

"com.sleepwalkers.ginrummy"	"Gin Rummy"	"100000"	"3.9"	"<div jsname=""sngebd"">Gin Rummy is a hugely popular card game, where the aim is to form sets and runs of cards before your opponent. It's simple and quick to play, and if you are new to the game then Gin Rummy provides everything you need to learn it!<br><br>A member of the Rummy family, Gin Rummy is an immensely popular card game owing to the high skill component of the game when compared to other casino card games.<br><br>It is a two-player card game. Gin Rummy is played with a standard 52-card pack of cards. The ranking from high to low is King, Queen, Jack, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, Ace (kings over aces). <br><br>The objective in gin rummy is to score points and reach an agreed number of points or more, usually 100, before the opponent does.<br><br>The basic game strategy is to improve one's hand by forming melds and eliminating deadwood. Gin has two types of meld: Sets of 3 or 4 cards sharing the same rank, e.g. 8♥ 8♦ 8♠; and runs of 3 or more cards in sequence, of the same suit. e.g. 3♥ 4♥ 5♥ or more. Deadwood cards are those not in any meld. Aces are considered low—they can form a set with other aces but only the low end of runs (A♠ 2♠ 3♠ is a legal run but Q♠ K♠ A♠ is not). <br><br>A player can form any combination of melds within their hand, whether it contains all sets, all runs, or a mix of both. A hand can contain three or fewer melds to knock or form legal gin.<br><br>The deadwood count is the sum of the point values of the deadwood cards—aces are scored at 1 point, face cards at 10, and others according to their numerical values. <br><br>Intersecting melds are not allowed; if a player has a 3-card set and a 3-card run sharing a common card, only one of the melds counts, and the other two cards count as deadwood.<br><br>Call Gin if you have no deadwood other than your discard, or knock if your deadwood is 10 points or less. At the end of a hand, the winner scores their opponent's deadwood points and a bonus for Gin!<br><br>After discarding a card, you can end the round by knocking if your deadwood point is less than or equal to 10. Then your opponent will have a chance to lay off his deadwood cards if those cards can form melds with those of yours. After that, if your deadwood point is less than your opponent's, you will be awarded a score equal to the difference in the deadwood points. But if your opponent has a smaller deadwood point, this is called an ""undercut"" and he will receive 25 points plus the difference in the deadwood points. <br><br>If you have no deadwood then your opponent will not be allowed to lay off, and an extra 25 points will be added to your score. The game ends when the score of a player reaches 300. <br><br>A player wins the hand by being the first to play all the cards in their hand by either melding, laying off or discarding. Once a player has gone out, the hand is ended. No other players may meld, lay off or discard their cards even if they have valid combinations already in their hand.<br><br>New and experienced players can all enjoy this game by utilizing the three different game type - Straight Gin, Oklahoma Gin, Hollywood Gin.<br><br>Saddle up and prepare for the most addictive Gin Rummy game.<br><br>Gin Rummy is a terrific game that you're sure to enjoy.

"com.sleepwalkers.hearts"	"Hearts"	"10000"	"3.8"	"<div jsname=""sngebd"">Hearts, one of the most popular, enduring card games in the world, is great fun for players of all ages, though the rules can be somewhat tricky for rookies.<br><br>Fall in love with Hearts. Hearts is structured to be played with four players, it is not difficult to learn but there is strategic play abound. Like other fun trick-taking card games, the rules of the game are not complicated.<br><br>Hearts is an ""evasion-type"" trick-taking playing card game for four players, although variations can accommodate 3–6 players. The classic card game where you can Shoot the Moon, but look out for the Queen of Spades!<br><br>Hearts is also known as Black Lady, The Dirty, Dark Lady, Slippery Anne, Chase the Lady, Crubs, Black Queen and Black Maria, though any of these may refer to the similar but differently-scored game Black Lady. The game is a member of the Whist family of trick-taking games (which also includes Bridge and Spades), but the game is unique among Whist variants in that it is an evasion-type game; players avoid winning certain penalty cards in tricks, usually by avoiding winning tricks altogether.<br><br>The overall objective is to be the player with the fewest points by the end of the game.<br><br>The Hearts Card Game has quite a few rules, but it is quite a well liked card game if you take the time to learn them. <br><br>If you take a break from other card games, then hearts is very interesting alternative. <br>Hearts is played in a clockwise order. Subsequent players are to play a card that is the same suit as the lead card. <br><br>This is known as following suit. If they do not have a card that is the same suit as the lead card then Heart players can play any card that they have. Among the cards they may choose to discard or “slough” is a penalty Heart or the Queen of Spades. The points accumulated by any penalties and the trick are given to the player of the highest card in the suit that was originally put into play. An ideal hand would have 0 points. The player who takes the trick will become the leader of the next trick. A leading trick player is not able to start with a heart unless they only have hearts in their hand or until the hearts have been “broken”. This means a player must play a heart while another suit is being played. Each round of Hearts will end when players have completed their hands. When a player reaches 100 points, the game will end. Whichever player has the LEAST amount of points wins!<br><br>Guarded high-cards should be saved until later in the game, especially if they are hearts. This will help to prevent someone from successfully Shooting the Moon. If the player who receives your discards likes to Shoot the Moon, you may wish to pass them a low heart. This may discourage them from making the attempt in the first place.<br><br>Come enjoy Hearts the way it's meant to be played! <br><br>Will you play it safe or go for the big score?<br><br>Try out this smashing Hearts game and see if you can win big.<br>Have you always wanted to try Hearts but never had the chance?

"com.sleepwalkers.spades"	"Spades"	"10000"	"3.6"	"<div jsname=""sngebd"">Spades is a partnership trick-taking card game, played with a single deck. The player opposite you at the table is your partner. Your opponents are seated at your left and right.<br><br>Spades raises the bar on graphics and interactivity in card games, to offer a simple, fun, and beautiful experience.<br><br>Spades can be played as either as a partnership or solo/cutthroat game. <br><br>The objective of spades is to take at least the number of tricks (also known as ""books"") that were bid before play of the hand began. Spades is a descendant of the Whist family of card games, which also includes other games. Its major difference as compared to other Whist variants is that, instead of trump being decided by the highest bidder or at random, the Spade suit is always trumps, hence the name.<br><br>Each hand in spades begins with all 52 cards being dealt to the players. The first dealer is chosen by a draw for ""first spade"" or ""high card"", and thereafter the deal passes to the dealer's left after each hand. The dealer shuffles, and the player to the right is given the opportunity to ""cut"" the cards to prevent the dealer stacking the deck. The entire deck is then dealt face-down one card at a time in clockwise order (with four players, each player should receive 13 cards). <br><br>Each player bids the number of tricks they expect to take. As Spades are always trump, no trump suit is named during bidding as with some other variants. A bid of ""zero"" is called ""nil""; the player must bid at least one if you don't want to bid ""nil"". Spades may not be led until either some player has played a spade.<br><br>Once the full hand has been played, the game is scored. If the bid for a team is met, each trick counts 10 points, with any additional tricks (sandbags) worth 1 point. If a bid is not met, each trick in the bid is worth -10 points. If a nil is bid and met, the team gets an additional 100 points. A won double nil gets 200 points. When either of these are not met, the team will get -100 and -200 points respectively. Once 10 sandbags are reached, the team looses 100 points and starts over with 0 sandbags again. Once the score is tallied after each hand, another deal begins. The first team to 500 points wins!<br><br>Use the power of your Spades to take the most tricks for your team. <br><br>Love trick taking card games? <br><br>This game of Spades is all set to have you hooked on for hours.<br><br>Do you have what it takes to be the Spades Champion?<br><br>Download for free and start playing now!<br><br>◆◆◆◆ Spades Features◆◆◆◆<br><br>✔✔ Fast-paced, competitive and fun - for free!<br>✔✔ 5 Different Card Styles<br>✔✔ 5 Different Boards<br>✔✔ Classic Style gameplay<br>✔✔ Phone and Tablet Support<br><br>Please Rate and review Spades and help us bring out more free games you enjoy.<br><br>We value your opinion, please post your Spades queries.<br><br>Enjoy playing Spades!</div>"	"0.00"	"Card"	"159"

Racing to get rid of all cards first, players can finish a game within less than a few minutes. Speed and accuracy is the key.<br><br>Speed card has been a long time preferred card game to play between two players. <br>The rules are fairly simple and can be taught to young children who possess basic math skills.<br>Each player is dealt five cards to form a hand, and 15 cards face down to form a draw pile. Two stacks of five cards, placed face down on each side between the players, serve as replacement piles. <br>Two cards are placed face up in the center between the replacement piles. Using cards from their hand, the players must simultaneously place cards one above or one below on top of the center stacks. For example, a pile with a six on top may have a five or a seven placed on. As there is no concept of turns, one can drop multiple cards simultaneously. Jokers are used as wild cards. <br><br>Ace is both a high and low card, considered one value above a King as well as one below a two, so that the cards form a looping sequence. Players will always have five cards. Whenever the number of cards in a player's hands drops below five, cards are dealt to the player to make them five cards, until that player's draw pile is empty. <br><br>When both players run out of options for play automatically card flip from the side piles onto the top of the central stacks. If these piles become depleted, the central stacks are shuffled individually and are placed face-down as new side piles from which cards can be flipped.<br><br>Forget taking turns!

You can now take advantage of the full power of Patch Tarot any time that suits you best.<br><br>For a bit of historical background, the Tarot is a detailed pictographic diagram of the universe and everything within it, and is based on many ancient teachings and spiritual practices; including but not limited to Qabalah and the Sacred Toroidal Field. Tarot encompasses the five elements (physical earth, emotional water, mental air, spiritual fire, and the astral - ether), describing how these five geometries weave together to depict the totality of life experiences, and the structure by which the laws of creation are set. Tarot is a language of symbology, numerology, cosmology, geometry, and art - which fuse together in an intricate web of ideas providing a means by which one’s consciousness can engage, and come to know itself better with. The Tarot then becomes a guidebook through the many different aspects of life, and supports a higher understanding of one’s experiences in a deeper, more meaningful way.<br><br>Over the ages, many different Tarot decks have been crafted. Patch Tarot is a continuation and evolution of today's most prominent Tarot decks of the past hundred years. This deck is a purposeful fusion of the most prominent symbolisms and descriptions across the most notable decks, into a singular unified Tarot deck made for you - the modern alchemical scholar. Herein you will find all of the familiarity of other great Tarot packs, such as Thoth and the Rider-Waite-Smith, along with a touch of Patchman for good measure.<br><br>One thing that should be noted about the Tarot and these esoteric connections is that for most people, the information is quite impenetrable. There are tens of thousands of books available in the world which seek to explore and dissect the symbolism of Tarot, and the understanding of the ancients for the modern mind; however there is so much information, that it is not easily comprehensible without a great deal of study. This brings us to where we are now, and the creation of a new deck - which seeks to make known the hidden mysteries in a simple, yet comprehensible manner: Patch Tarot.</div>"	"2.99"	"Card"	"87"

The higher level opponents are more likely to knock, whereas the lower levels prefer to play for gin.  Higher level opponents rarely pick up cards from the discard pile to avoid revealing their hand.  And just like the real-life pros, the highest level opponents keep track of discards to know which cards are still “live”.<br><br>2) Do the opponents cheat?<br>Absolutely not!  They don't get better cards, they can not see your hand.  How would that be fun for you, our valued customer?  <br><br>3) How are the cards dealt?<br>Cards are dealt randomly, just as if you were using a real deck.  <br><br>4) So why am I not winning?<br>Gin Rummy is a complicated game.  While easy to learn, it requires a lot of skill and strategy to master.  Check out the “Strategy” section under Help for some valuable tips and tricks.<br><br>5) But sometimes the opponent knocks right away. <br>In any card game there is also a lot of luck.  If you play for a while, you'll get your share of lucky hands too!<br><br>6) Why didn't my game download?<br>Occasionally there are glitches that interrupt a download and cause it to fail.  Usually if you just try again it will work fine.  If not, you may want to clear the Market cache by going to Settings -&gt; Applications -&gt; Manage Applications -&gt; All -&gt; Market -&gt; Clear Cache AND Force Stop.  Then retry the download.

"com.tripeakssolitaire"	"TriPeaks Solitaire"	"1000"	"4.4"	"<div jsname=""sngebd""><b>TriPeaks Solitaire Rules</b><br><br><b>Setup</b><br><br>The game board in Tri Peaks Solitaire is made up of:<br>	<b>•	Three Peaks:</b> There are three peaks (pyramids), each one is 4 cards high. The peaks share the lowest level. The cards at the bottom are face up, the higher ones are face down.<br>	<b>•	The Stock:</b> The facedown pile on the bottom left. It is used to draw cards from and put on the Waste.<br>	<b>•	The Waste:</b> The faceup pile next to the Stock. It's empty in the beginning.<br><br><b>Gameplay</b><br><br>The objective of the game is is to move all cards from the three Peaks onto the Waste. You can only move open cards to the Waste, a card is considered open if there are no other cards covering it. At the beginning the whole bottom row is open. Once you move cards from the Peaks you open up other cards that you can then flip over and are then open to move to the Waste as well.<br><br>You can move a card onto the Waste if it ranks one higher, or one lower than the topmost card on the waste. E.g. if there's a 6 on the Waste you can move a 5 or a 7 there. Initially the Waste is empty and you can move any card there. You are allowed to ""turn the corner"", i.e. go K A 2 A K, you can put an Ace on a 2 or a King.<br><br>If you have no cards in the Peaks that can be moved to the Waste then you can get a card from the Stock and turn it over to the Waste. You can only go one time through the Stock, there are no resets allowed, so don't use the Stock unless you definitely can't move any cards from the Peaks.<br><br><b>Winning</b><br><br>You win the game by moving all cards from all three Peaks to the Waste. The cards left in the Stock when you finish does not matter.<br><br><b>Losing</b><br><br>When you can't move any cards from the Peaks and you have no more cards left in the Stock then you have lost the game. The game will notify you about this, but you are free to use the Undo button to try to figure out some other solution.<br><br><b>Scoring</b><br><br>The score is based on the number of cards left at the end. You win by having no cards left. The game also counts the moves you make to win, so a win with fewer moves is considered better. The game tracks the best results for each of the 50.000 numbered games, and you will be notified if you are the first to win a game, if you break a record, or if you have the best result for a particular game, even if you don't finish it.<br><br><b>Winnable %</b><br><br>According to Wikipedia the game was invented by Robert Hogue in 1989. He performed computer statistical analysis on the original game, which showed that over 90% of all dealt games are solvable.</div>"	"0.00"	"Card"	"25"

It is almost certain that they are descended from the European family of Jass games, which originated in the Netherlands. Probably they were brought to the Indian subcontinent by Dutch traders.<br><br><b>29 is usually played by four players in fixed partnerships, partners facing each other.</b><br><br>32 cards from a standard 52-card pack are used for play. There are eight cards in each of the usual ""French"" suits: hearts, diamonds, clubs and spades. The cards in every suit rank from high to low: J-9-A-10-K-Q-8-7. The aim of the game is to win tricks containing valuable cards. The values of the cards are:<br><b>Jacks - 3 points each<br>Nines - 2 points each<br>Aces - 1 point each<br>Tens - 1 point each<br>Other cards (K, Q, 8, 7) no points</b><br><br>This gives a total of 28 points for cards. In some versions of the game, the last trick is worth an extra card point, for a total of 29: this total explains the name of the game. Most players nowadays do not count the point for the last trick, but the name of the game is still 29, even when playing this version with only 28 points.<br><br>Traditionally, the Twos, Threes Fours and Fives discarded from the full 52-card pack are used as trump indicators: each player takes a set of these cards, one of each suit. The Sixes are used to keep score: each partnership uses one red and one black Six for this purpose.<br><br><b>FEATURES :<br>★★★★★ Free chips and a lot of bonuses daily. ★★★★★<br>★★★★★ Personalized profile with custom avatars. ★★★★★<br>★★★★★ Beautiful graphics and luxurious casinos. ★★★★★<br>★★★★★ Simple interface that's easy to navigate. ★★★★★<br>★★★★★ 10 Real Location Tables to choose from ★★★★★</b></div>"	"0.00"	"Card"	"3462"

In Call Break the term ""Hand"" is used instead of trick, and ""Call"" is used instead of bid. After each deal player have to make a ""Call"" or ""Bid"" for the number of hands he/she can capture, and the goal is to capture at least that many hand in a round, and try to break other player i.e. stop them from getting their Call. After each round, points will be calculated and after five rounds of play each players five rounds points will be added as a total points and player with highest total point will win.<br><br>DEAL &amp; BID<br><br>There will be five rounds of play or five deals in a game. First dealer will be chosen randomly and after that, the turn to deal rotates Anticlockwise from first dealer. Dealer will deal all 52 cards to four players i.e. 13 each. After the completion of each deal, player left to dealer will Place a Bid - which is a number of hands( or tricks) he/she thinks will probably going to capture, and call moves again in Anticlockwise to next player until all 4 players finished calling.<br><br>GAME PLAY<br><br>After each player completes their call, player next to dealer will make the first move, this first player can throw any card, suit thrown by this player will be the led suit and each player after him/her must follow the same suit,  if they don't have this suit at all then they must break this suit by the trump card( which is Spade of any rank), if they don't have spade also then they can throw any other card. The highest card of the led suit will capture the hand, but if the led suit was broken by spade(s), then in this case highest ranked card of spade will capture the hand. The winner of a hand will leads to the next hand. In this way the round continues until the completion of 13 hands and after that next deal will begin.<br><br>POINTS<br><br>After each round, points will be updated for every player. If a player captured at least the number of call he/she had made, then for every call to capture a player made - one point is given to that player and for extra captures - a single digit decimal of this extra capture number will be added to the points total i.e. if someone had made a call of 4 and he captured 5 hands then he will be given 4.1 or if the call was 3 then point would have been 3.2. But if a player didn't capture the call that he had made, then the total number of call would be subtracted from his total.<br><br>RESULT<br><br>At the end of fifth round the winner will be decided, player with higher total points will win the game.<br><br>If any player place Bid of 8 (eight) or more and do Hands more or equal to bid count, he/she will become winner of the game at any round.<br><br>***SPECIAL FEATURES***<br><br>*PRIVATE TABLE<br>Instead of playing Five Rounds you can select Number of Rounds(ex. 3 Rounds, 4 Rounds, 5 Rounds) and Boot value For Higher Tables.<br><br>*COIN BOX<br>-You will get Free Coins Continuously while playing.<br><br>*HD GRAPHICS &amp; MELODY SOUNDS<br>-Here you will experience amazing Sound quality and Eye catching User Interface.<br><br>*DAILY REWARD<br>-Come back everyday and get Free Coins as Daily Bonus.<br><br>*REWARD<br>-You can also Get Free Coins(Reward) by watching Rewarded Video.<br><br>*LEADERBOARD<br>-You can compete with other player around the world for getting first position on Leaderboard, Play Center Leaderboard will help you to find your position.<br><br>*NO INTERNET CONNECTION REQUIRED FOR GAME PLAY<br>-For playing game you don't required Internet connection as you are playing with Computer Players(Bot). <br><br>Callbreak is also known as Lakdi/Lakadi in India and Nepal.<br><br>If you have any issues, we request you to mail us or send feedback at our support id rather than giving us a negative review.<br><br>Support ID : help.unrealgames@gmail.com, You can also send Feedback from settings menu.</div>"	"0.00"	"Card"	"4634"

It is almost certain that they are descended from the European family of Jass games, which originated in the Netherlands. Probably they were brought to the Indian subcontinent by Dutch traders.<br><br>29 is usually played by four players in fixed partnerships, partners facing each other.<br><br>32 cards from a standard 52-card pack are used for play. There are eight cards in each of the usual ""French"" suits: hearts, diamonds, clubs and spades. The cards in every suit rank from high to low: J-9-A-10-K-Q-8-7. The aim of the game is to win tricks containing valuable cards. <br><br>The values of the cards are:<br>Jacks - 3 points each<br>Nines - 2 points each<br>Aces - 1 point each<br>Tens - 1 point each<br>Other cards (K, Q, 8, 7) no points<br><br>This gives a total of 28 points for cards. In some versions of the game, the last trick is worth an extra card point, for a total of 29: this total explains the name of the game. Most players nowadays do not count the point for the last trick, but the name of the game is still 29, even when playing this version with only 28 points.<br><br>Traditionally, the Twos, Threes Fours and Fives discarded from the full 52-card pack are used as trump indicators: each player takes a set of these cards, one of each suit. The Sixes are used to keep score: each partnership uses one red and one black Six for this purpose.<br><br>***SPECIAL FEATURES***<br><br>*PRIVATE TABLE<br>-Create Custom/Private Tables with custom boot amount.<br><br>*COIN BOX<br>-You will get Free Coins Continuously while playing.<br><br>*HD GRAPHICS &amp; MELODY SOUNDS<br>-Here you will experience amazing Sound quality and Eye catching User Interface.<br><br>*DAILY REWARD<br>-Come back everyday and get Free Coins as Daily Bonus.<br><br>*REWARD<br>-You can also Get Free Coins(Reward) by watching Rewarded Video.<br><br>*LEADERBOARD<br>-You can compete with other player around the world for getting first position on Leaderboard, Play Center Leaderboard will help you to find your position.<br><br>*NO INTERNET CONNECTION REQUIRED FOR GAME PLAY<br>-For playing game you don't required Internet connection as you are playing with Computer Players(Bot).<br><br><br>*** A VERY THOROUGH APPLICATION ***<br><br>- Easy to learn, smooth game play, card animations for a more realistic game experience.<br>- Opponents endowed with advanced AI. <br>- Statistics on games played. <br>- Game rules included in the application.<br><br>Do you have questions about the game?

It gets closer to the war, but gives the ability to type the heap of cards from the center when two cards of the same value follow each other to retrieve all the cards from the heap. Thus, the Corsican battle involves concentration, reflexes and memory to win. It can be played from 2 to 4 players<br>At the beginning of the game, all cards are distributed to the players. These cards are held in two piles, face down, in front of each player.<br>The first player discovers the card at the top of his heap (without looking at it, in fact the game must be fast) and puts it in the center of the mat. The player to his left does the same, and so on. When a figure or an ace appears, the next player must also take out a figure or ace. For this, he is entitled to a number of attempts:<br>five attempts for a wild card;<br>four attempts for an Ace;<br>three for a king;<br>two for a lady;<br>and one for a valet.<br>If he fails, the player who placed the face or Ace picks up the central heap and puts it at the bottom of his pack. <br>To this first rule is added another which makes the game more dynamic and especially non-deterministic: if the player who discovers his card, lays a card of the same value on the heap as the previous card, then the players must cover the central heap with their hand. The first player to put his hand on the pile wins the cards in his game. <br>The winner is the first player to win all cards. After a figure or an Ace is out, if the player who is trying to do the same has no more cards, he comes out of the game, and it is up to the next player to complete the contract, minus the number of attempts already carried out by the former. <br><br>Generally, a player who has lost the possibility of continuing to hit the doubles will be allowed to return to the game....  …<br>Fan of card games?

We spent three years carefully crafted, just to bring you the most intelligent challenge opponent! The game needs 3 players, one is the landlord, and the other two are farmers. Both sides fight, and the victory party is whose member finishes out his or her cards first.<br>[Game Rules]<br>1. Deal cards<br>A shuffled pack of 54 cards is dealt to three players. Each player is dealt 17 cards, with the last three remaining cards placed on the playing desk face down. These three cards cannot be seen before the landlord is determined. <br><br>2. Bid for position of landlord <br>All players take turns bidding for the position of landlord. If no one is willing to accept the position, the system once again deals cards and then all players bid for the landlord position, until the landlord is determined.<br><br>3. The first bidder<br>Generally speaking, the first bidder is randomly chosen by the system.<br><br>4. Outbid for the landlord position<br>A. After a player bids for the landlord position, others have only one chance to “outbid” in sequence for the position. The player becomes the landlord after he or she outbids for the position and others give up.<br>B. If no one outbids for the position, the bidding player becomes the landlord.<br>C. Each time when a player outbids for the position, the risk stakes double.<br>D. Players who gave up bidding for the position cannot outbid for the position either.<br><br>5. Raise the risk stakes<br>A. When the landlord is determined and receives the remaining three cards, he or she can opt whether or not to double the risk stakes.<br>B. The landlord needs to make a decision within the time limit and then await others to make their decisions within the time limit. Then the landlord begins to play the cards.<br><br>6. Play cards<br>The remaining three cards are shown to all players and then given to the landlord. The landlord begins playing cards first and then others play cards in counterclockwise order. Players can opt to pass or beat the prior hand. A game is over when a player has no cards remaining.<br><br>7. Hand types<br>Rocket: Colored Joker and black-and-white Joker.

La visión panorámica de los bots es limitada, por lo que detectan más fácilmente las señas de su compañero y tienen más dificultades para ver las señas de los rivales. Además, algunos bots tienen mayor habilidad para cazar señas (ver las características de los bots).<br><br>Desde la versión 1.5 los bots son mucho más interactivos. Te consultarán para cortar el mus y para aceptar o no órdagos y apuestas grandes (tú también podrás preguntarle a tu compañero).<br><br>El Mus es muy configurable, permitiendo:<br> - Invitar a tus amigos a jugar al mus<br> - Recibir invitaciones de tus amigos para jugar<br> - Jugar partidas rápidas con otros jugadores<br> - Jugar con 7 bots diferentes<br> - Elegir un avatar hombre o mujer<br> - Jugar torneos o partidas sueltas<br> - Conseguir 26 hitos diferentes<br> - Escalar posiciones en el Musómetro, Torneómetro y Victorias en Red<br> - Ver tus estadísticas<br> - Ajustar la velocidad del juego<br> - Seleccionar el número de juegos para ganar<br> - Elegir entre 30 o 40 piedras por juego<br> - Con o sin sonido<br> - Activar el ""Modo graciosillo"" con frases del mus apropiadas a la situación<br><br>El Mus está disponible para cualquier móvil o tableta Android (4.0 o superior).<br><br>Puedes consultar las reglas del mus en los siguientes enlaces:<br>http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mus<br>http://www.nhfournier.es/public/assets/Reglamentos_5/Reglamento_El_Mus.pdf<br><br>Contacta con nosotros en producciones.don.naipe@gmail.com para contarnos tus impresiones, sugerencias de mejora o solución de problemas.<br><br>¡Muchísimas gracias por apoyarnos!<br><br>¿Te gusta darle al naipe?

Cada jugador compite con el resto para llegar primero a 0 puntos partiendo de una misma puntuación inicial. Para conseguirlo los jugadores participan en una serie de rondas en las que con cada baza conseguida se reduce un punto.

El jugador mano está obligado a jugar y decide el palo del pinte con sus cartas. Si con sus dos cartas la mano no se decide, puede elegir que pinte su siguiente carta (sin verla). Si pintan COPAS, todos están obligados a jugar, y si pintan BASTOS la puntuación es doble (tanto a favor como en contra).<br><br>Conocido el palo que pinta, los jugadores restantes deciden con sus 2 cartas si disputan o no la ronda (siempre que no estén obligados a jugar).

"donnaipe.rapido"	"Fast Cards"	"5000"	"4.4"	"<div jsname=""sngebd"">Don Naipe brings you ""Fast Cards"", a fantastic adaptation of the well-known games ""Spit"" and ""Speed"" for the Spanish card deck. The spirit of the original games remains the same: two players compete to get rid of their cards as soon as possible. The players do not take turns, so speed and alertness are key to beat your opponent. Through a series of rounds, the player who gets rid of all his/her cards wins the game.<br><br>Each player has a hand of four cards faced up that can be played onto either of the two spit piles. To play a card on a spit pile it has to be next in sequence up or down. For example, if there is an ace in a spit pile, a king or a two can be played (the suit does not matter).<br><br>If neither player can make a movement, each turns up their next spit card and places it on top of the spit pile they started. Play then continues as before.<br><br>If a player has no more spit cards in his/her pile, then the other player spits alone on only one spit pile. The player can choose either pile, but having chosen, must continue to spit on that pile whenever no play is possible until one player runs out of stock cards.<br><br>Fast Cards employs the Spanish card deck, more colourful and vivid than the French card deck. The essence of the Spit and Speed is not missed at all; just notice that the sequence of cards is the following: ace, two, three, four, five, six, seven, jack (sota), horse (caballo) and king (rey).<br><br>Fast Cards is very versatile and configurable, allowing the following options:<br><br> * Game: ""speed"" or ""spit"". The layout changes with the type of game. In the speed variant, each player has a single face down stockpile that is used to replace his/her hand (up to 4 cards) and to feed the spit piles. In the spit variant, each player has four stock piles in a row that can be turned up once there is no other card on top.<br><br> * Mode: ""challenge"" or ""survival"". In challenge mode you have to try to win the bot in a game. In survival mode the speed of the bot will be increased with each new level.<br>         <br> * Speed: parametrize the speed of the bot, ranging from ""snail"" to ""lightning"". In challenge mode the speed will be kept the same, while in survival mode it will be increased with each new level.<br>         <br> * Artificial intelligence: ""average"" or ""good"". In the former case, the behavior of the bot is simpler, it will just try to play its cards minimizing the distance moved. In the latter case, the bot is more cunning and it will consider the opponents' cards in order to make a movement.<br>         <br> * Sound: on or off<br><br>Fast Cards is available for every Android mobile or tablet (Android version 3.0 or upper).<br><br>You can check the rules of Speed and Spit here:<br>http://www.pagat.com/patience/spit.html<br><br>Contact us at producciones.don.naipe@gmail.com and give as your feedback and request help in case of problems.<br><br>Many thanks for your support!<br><br>Do you like card games?

"donnaipe.subastado"	"Tute Subastado"	"10000"	"4.2"	"<div jsname=""sngebd"">El nuevo juego de Don Naipe es el Tute Subastado, uno de los juegos clásicos de baraja española.<br><br>El tute subastado, también conocido como ""subastao"", es una popular variante del tute para tres jugadores que es tremendamente divertida. Se juega con una baraja española de 36 cartas, es decir, quitando los doses a la baraja clásica de 40 cartas. En cada mano se reparten todas las cartas, correspondiendo 12 a cada jugador, y sin marcar el pinte. La característica principal del tute subastado es una ronda de subasta en la que cada jugador apuesta el número de puntos que es capaz de ganar con sus cartas. El jugador que apueste más puntos se queda con la subasta, eligiendo el palo del pinte y saliendo.<br><br>Tras la fase de subasta, el juego se desarrollará como en el tute tradicional. El subastador intentará conseguir al menos los puntos declarados, mientras que los otros dos jugadores se aliarán para impedírselo. El subastador puede cantar tras hacer baza y empezando con las 40 si tuviera varios cánticos. El ganador de la última baza se llevará las 10 de monte. <br><br>Finalizada la ronda se realiza el recuento. Si el subastador consigue al menos los puntos subastados se los apuntará a su marcador. En caso contrario, los rivales se repartirán los puntos de la subasta. El primer jugador que alcance la puntuación objetivo gana la partida.<br><br>Como siempre, hemos intentado respetar la esencia del juego original. Así, no se barajea entre rondas para que las manos sean más irregulares, abundando los palos largos y los fallos. Por otra parte, la subasta mínima es de 60 puntos y no se permite réplica para que el juego sea más interesante: el que subaste corto perderá con frecuencia la subasta o dejará de hacer muchos puntos.<br><br>Tute Subastado está sólo disponible en modo individual (de momento). Como siempre, la inteligencia artificial la hemos cuidado al máximo y no podemos estar más satisfechos con el resultado: en el nivel más alto los bots subastan con gran criterio y juegan sus cartas como los ángeles (tanto al subastar como a la contra).

Luego se reparten las cartas de manera alterna empezando por el jugador que sale. Esto no evita que puedan producirse rachas, en un sentido o en otro, pero esto ocurre también en la realidad.<br><br>Por último, no tenemos ningún interés en que la gente pierda, sino que pase un buen rato con Tute a Cuatro. Y para ello tengo que asegurar que el reparto de cartas sea equitativo (por eso uso el algoritmo de Fisher-Yates) y que la inteligencia artificial sea lo suficientemente buena como para suponga un reto jugar.

Basra is a variant of Krypkasino in which the objective is reversed.<br><br>The aim in Cassino, in other word Basra, is to capture cards from a layout of face up cards on the table. A card is captured by playing a matching card from hand. It is also possible to capture several cards at once if their values add up to the value of the card played. Captured cards are stored face down in front of the player who captured them and scored at the end of the play. Cards from hand can also be combined with table cards into builds, which can only be captured as a unit.<br><br>There are many variants of this game. The most common rules are applied to Basra Club. 2 game types and 2 mode of them has been developed. <br><br>You can choose Single or Partnership modes to play Classic Basra or Bluffing Basra. The rules are almost the same in all the variation in Basra Club. In Partnership, the score is calculated for the teams. In Bluffing, the players of teams can bluff in the case of Basra / Pişti. <br><br>The Rules:<br>1-) At the beginning of the game, 4 cards are put on the pile. The last card is face up, the others are face down.<br><br>2-) One of the players will deal four cards for each and the dealer is changed each round.<br><br>3-) The player to dealer's right begins, and the turn to play passes anticlockwise. A turn consists of playing one card from your hand face up on top of the discard pile<br><br>4-) If rank of the played card matches the rank of the previous card on the pile, the playing player / team captures the whole pile. <br><br>5-) Playing a jack also captures the whole pile, no matter what card is on top of it.<br><br>6-) If the played card is not a jack and is not equal to the previous top card of the pile, the played card is simply added to the top of the pile.<br><br>7-) The team or the player which makes the first capture also gets the cards which were dealt to the centre of the table.<br> <br>8-) Basra / Pişti<br>8.1-) If the pile consists of just one card and the next player captures it by playing a matching card (not a jack), the capturing team scores a 10 point bonus for a basra / pişti. <br>8.2-) If the pile consists of just a single jack and you capture it with another jack, this counts as a double basra / pişti, worth 20 points. <br>8.3-) In Bluffing, the player / the team can bluff. If the opponent buys it, 10 points is earned. If not, the opponent get 10 points for normal basra / pişti. If double basra / pişti is the case the scores are 20 points.<br>8-4-) In Bluffing, if the opponent thinks true basra / pişti as a bluff then pişti points are multiplied x2.<br><br>9-) Quick Tips for Bluffing:<br>When there is a single card on the table, the next player can play a single card on top of it face down, claiming a basra / pişti. If the player of the first card believes this, it counts as a pişti for 10 points, and the card played is not shown. If the player of the first card does not believe it, the second card is turned face up. If it really matches the first card, then the basra / pişti scores double 20 points. If the second card was a bluff, and does not match the first card, the team / the player which exposes the bluff scores 10 points; in that case the two cards remain on the table and play continues. If you bluff when the face up card is a jack, then you will score 20 for a double basra / pişti if you are believed, and if not the score will be doubled to 40.<br><br>10-) Scoring:<br>Each Jack -&gt; 1 point <br>Each Ace -&gt; 1 point<br>Club 2 -&gt; 2 points<br>Diamond 10 -&gt; 3 points<br>Majority of Cards -&gt; 3 points<br>Each Basra / Pişti -&gt; 10 points*<br>*Basra / Pişti scores vary in Bluffing as described above.</div>"	"0.00"	"Card"	"78"

The deal then alternates between players. Each player is dealt six cards and the top card of the remaining deck is turned face-up to show the trump suit. The remaining stock is placed crosswise on the trump card.<br><br>The non-dealer leads to the first trick. A trick is taken by the highest card of the suit led that is in the trick, unless the trick contains a card from the trump suit, in which case it is taken by the highest trump card in the trick. Until the stock is gone, there is no obligation to follow suit or to trump. The trick is taken by the winner, turned face down, and should not be looked at again. The winner scores the value of the two cards in the trick, as shown on the table above. Players must remember how many points they have taken since their scores may not be recorded, and they are not allowed to look back at previous tricks. Once the trick is played, the winner takes the top card of the stock to replenish his hand, then the loser does the same. The winner of the trick leads to the next trick.<br><br>The holder of the lowest trump card, the nine, can exchange it for the turned up trump. This can be done only by a player who has the lead and has won at least one trick. This exchange cannot be done in the middle of a trick. It must be done just after the players restock their hands, when no cards are in play.<br><br>On his turn when he has the lead, a player may marry a Queen-King couple of the same suit by playing one and simultaneously showing the other. Regular marriages are worth 20 card points and trump marriages are worth 40. A marriage or meld is usually announced in some way to the other player, often by saying the number of points made. The points do not count towards the player's total until he has taken at least one trick.<br><br>Once the stock is gone, with the turned up trump taken by the loser of the sixth trick, the rules of play change to become more strict. Players now must follow the suit led (winning the trick when possible), they must trump if they have no cards of the suit led, and marriages can no longer be played.<br><br>Closing indicates that the closer has a good enough hand to reach the 66-point target under the stock-depleted rules above. The player must be on lead to the next trick in order to close. It is indicated by turning over the face-up trump card, before or after taking cards to make the hands back up to 6 cards. The rules change to the strict rules given above for play after the stock is depleted. The stock is now ""closed"" and players do not replenish their hands, and there is no 10-point bonus for taking the last trick. If the closer reaches 66 card-points first, he scores game points as described below. If he fails to reach 66 card-points or his opponent reaches 66 card-points first, his opponent scores 2 game points, or 3 if that opponent has no tricks.<br><br>A player who thinks that the points in the tricks he or she has taken together with those from any marriages add up to 66 or more, stops the game and begins counting card points. If the player who stopped the game does not have 66 card and marriage points, then the opponent wins 2 game points, or 3 if that opponent has taken no tricks. If the player does have 66 points, then he or she wins game points as follows.<br><br>One game point if the opponent has 33 or more card points.<br>Two game points if the opponent won at least one trick and has 0–32 card points</div>"	"0.00"	"Card"	"109"

You wait for your turn, roll the dice and move your coins according to the random number that shows up on the dice. You can configure the rules of ludo and play with bot or other players at once. Ludo multiplayer is coming soon, so stay tuned.<br><br><b>Kitti - 9 Cards</b><br>Kitti is a short, fun game played with 9 cards each between 2-5 players. In Kitti you arrange the three groups of cards, 3 in each. Just like Teen-Patti or Faras, but to win the round, you should win two shows consecutively. Unlike call break, you show three cards at a time. Once the Kitti cards are arranged in three groups of three cards each, you show one group at a time, and compare with the other players' group. If your group of cards wins, you win that one show. The Kitti game runs for three shows each round. If nobody wins the round (ie. no consecutive winning shows), we call it a Kitti, and shuffle the cards again.<br><br><b>Solitaire – Classic</b><br>After Call Break, Solitaire is probably the most played card game ever. This game includes a classic version of solitaire game that you used to play in a PC. Solitaire game is pretty easy to play and the rules are simple. The version of Solitaire included in this game requires you to chain the alternate cards. That means a red card can be chained with a black card. This rule makes solitaire a bit more challenging.<br><br><b>Jutpatti – Pair Cards</b><br>Jutpatti is a pretty simple game played by children, or beginners. Jutpatti means ""pair cards"". You can distribute 3 to 11 cards between two or more players, and keep half of the shuffled cards face down. Turn by turn you pick the card from the face-down deck, or the one that the previous player throws. Once you pick the card, you have an even number of cards in your hand. Your target is to make sure there is a pair for every number. In Jutpatti, a joker is assigned right after distributing the cards. The joker is the next card in the deck, that is shown with face-up, and put besides or under the remaining cards. Joker is not the card that's face down, but the +1 cards. For example, if you turned 8 as face up, 9 is the joker; if J is face up then Q is the joker. A joker can be used as a replacement for any card to make a pair with.<br><br>We're working to include even more card games, include more controls and options in existing games, and building a multiplayer platform.

"obssmobile.pisti"	"Pişti"	"100000"	"3.9"	"<div jsname=""sngebd"">Pişti (pronounced ""pishti"") is a popular Turkish card game, using a standard 52 card pack. It is normally played by four people in partnerships, partners sitting opposite. The direction of play is anticlockwise.<br><br>Cards are played to a central pile, which can be captured by matching the previous card played or playing a jack. Points are scored for certain captured cards. The word ""pişti"", describes a capture of a pile containing only one card, for which extra points are scored.<br><br>The Play<br><br>The player to dealer's right begins, and the turn to play passes anticlockwise. A turn consists of playing one card from your hand face up on top of the discard pile.<br><br>If rank of the played card matches the rank of the previous card on the pile, the playing team captures the whole pile. The captured cards are stored face down in front of one member of the team. The next player will then start a new discard pile by playing a card face up to the empty table.<br><br>Playing a jack also captures the whole pile, no matter what card is on top of it.<br><br>If the played card is not a jack and is not equal to the previous top card of the pile, the played card is simply added to the top of the pile.<br><br>The team which makes the first capture also gets the cards which were dealt to the centre of the table. Both members of the capturing team can look at these cards, but the other team are not allowed to see them.<br><br>Further Deals<br><br>When all the players have played their four cards, the dealer deals another batch of four cards to each player from the stock (but no more to the centre of the table) and play continues. When these cards are played, the dealer deals a further batch of four cards each. With four players, this third deal exhausts the stock (the dealer will get the exposed card from the bottom of the pack). When everyone has played their last four cards, any cards remaining in the discard pile are given to the last team that made a capture. The play of the hand is now over, and the teams score for the cards they have captured (see below).<br><br>Pişti<br><br>If the pile consists of just one card and the next player captures it by playing a matching card (not a jack), the capturing team scores a 10 point bonus for a pişti. The capturing card is placed face up in the team's capture pile as a way of remembering the 10 points when scoring. If the pile consists of just a single jack and you capture it with another jack, this counts as a double pişti, worth 20 points.

So the first card can be the ace of diamonds<br>followed by the two of spades, the three of hearts, etc. Kings are wild. This means that you can play king<br>on any centre stack and it will turn into a card that fits on the card already on the stack. For instance<br>if you play the king of spades on a ten of clubs the king will turn into a queen.<br><br>When a centre stack is completed (by playing a queen or king on a jack) the stack is shuffled into the stock pile. <br><br>You can place any card on the side stacks, independent of which cards are already there. Only the top card of each side<br>stack is accessible though, see below.<br><br>At the start of your turn you receive cards from the stock pile to bring your hand back up to a total of 5 cards. <br>In your turn you can play a number of possible moves:<br>- Play the top card from your pay-off pile onto one of the center stacks.<br>- Play the top card from one of your side stacks onto one of the center stacks.<br>- Play a card from your hand onto one of the center stacks.<br>- Play a card from your hand onto one of your side stacks. This ends your turn.<br><br>The game ends when one player plays his/her last card from the pay-off pile onto one of the centre stacks.<br>This player wins the game and receives the number of cards on the other players pay-off pile as points.<br><br>The game also ends when the stock is depleted. When this happens the game ends in a tie and neither player scores any points. <br><br>The first player to reach 50 points wins the match!</div>"	"0.00"	"Card"	"610"

The deck is shuffled, and each player receives six cards.

This determines the trump suit, however the revealed card is actually a part of the deck, the last card to be drawn. The player with the lowest trump is the first attacker. A deck of 36 cards limits the number of players to six, although some variants allow more than one deck to be used. If multiple games have been played, often the loser of the previous game shuffles and deals.<br>	Russian durak is a very important part of board game and card game culture.

The one who covers must cover every card that is thrown under him with a card of the same suit, but of greater dignity, or any trump card. A trump card can only be covered by a trump of greater dignity. The trump suit is defined by the card under the deck. You can throw cards of the same value as the cards lying on the table. If you cover everything covered, and there is nothing more to throw (or do not want to), press ""Pass"". If you have nothing to hide (or do not want to), click ""Take"". You can throw no more than 6 cards, or no more than there are cards from the hiding. If the one who fought is beaten off, then the next first move follows him. If he did, the next clockwise player will walk. The player with the first card out of money wins. If several players have played, the remaining players play until one loser with the cards remains. The last player with cards on his hands becomes durak.<br><br>Join game and thousands of other players who enjoy the game they love since childhood, RIGHT NOW!</div>"	"0.00"	"Card"	"38364"

"tr.com.obss.mobile.android.king"	"Turkish King"	"100000"	"3.7"	"<div jsname=""sngebd"">Turkish King, is a trick-taking card game similar to Hearts and Barbu (popular in France) where four players take turns leading seven different sub-games (known as contracts) over the course of 20 deals.<br><br>King uses 52-card pack as for bridge or poker, ranking as usual from highest to lowest A K Q J 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 in each of the four suits. In the course of a session, each player will get the chance to declare five contracts, so that there are 20 hands played in all.<br><br>Over the course of 20 hands, each player must declare a trump contract two times and a negative contract three times. Each of the six negative contracts can only be declared twice per game, so if a negative contract has been played twice, the declarer cannot choose that contract.<br><br>Trump Contracts <br><br>Declarer chooses a trump suit (notrump is not an option). The declarer leads to the first trick. A trick is won by the highest trump in it, or if it contains no trump, by the highest card of the suit led. Players must follow suit if possible -- if they cannot, they must play a trump if they have any (even if this forces them to underruff). The winner of a trick leads to the next. Each trick scores +50 points to the player winning it. The total score for the contract is therefore +650.<br><br>Card-based Negative Contracts<br><br>No King: The King of Hearts is the only penalty card, scoring -320 to the player winning it in a trick. Hearts may not be led unless they have already been discarded on a previous trick, or the player on lead has nothing but hearts in her hand.<br><br>No Queens: The four queens are penalty cards, each one scoring -100 points to the player winning it in a trick. The total score for the contract is therefore -400.<br><br>No Boys: The four kings and four jacks are penalty cards, each one scoring -60 points to the player winning it in a trick. The total score for the contract is therefore -480.<br><br>No Hearts: The thirteen hearts are penalty cards, each one scoring -30 points to the player winning it in a trick. The total score for the contract is therefore -390. Hearts may not be led unless they have already been discarded on a previous trick, or the player on lead has nothing but hearts in her hand.<br><br>Trick-based Negative Contracts<br><br>No Last Two: The last two tricks each score -180 to the player(s) that wins them. The total score for the contract is therefore -360.<br><br>No Tricks: Each trick scores -50 points to the player winning it. The total score for the contract is therefore -650.<br><br>The scores are cunningly chosen so that the total over twenty hands is 0.</div>"	"0.00"	"Card"	"403"

Акулина способствует развитию внимания и сообразительности.Играют колодой из 36 карт. <br><br>Сдаются все карты по одной каждому игроку. После раздачи все смотрят свои карты. Суть игры – отобрать из имеющихся карт парные (скажем, восьмерка и восьмерка, король и король, туз и туз) и отложить их в сторону. Но одна из карт не должна иметь себе пары. Это относится к «зловещей» пиковой даме, которую и нарекли Акулиной.<br><br>У каждого игрока после сноса парных карт остается еще по несколько, а у одного из игроков кроме этого на руках будет и Акулина или Ведьма. С имеющимися на руках картами и проходит игра. Игроки по очереди (обычно слева направо) предлагают соседу (сидящему, понятно, справа) вытащить одну карту вслепую, т.е. вытаскивающий не видит, какую карту он будет брать у соседа, который держит свои карты «к орденам», то есть лицевой стороной к себе. После этого вытащивший одну карту смотрит, есть ли у него для этой карты парная. Если есть, то он эту пару откладывает в сторону, и у него на руках остается уже меньше карт. Если же он вытащит пиковую даму, то он не должен, повторяем, ее сносить, хотя бы на руках у него и оказалась парная дама. Если парной карты к вытащенной у соседа у игрока нет, то он, так же как и если бы выбросил парные карты в сторону, продолжает игру, предлагая своему соседу справа вытащить у него одну карту. Благодаря вытягиванию карт ведьма непрерывно меняет хозяина.<br><br>Через несколько кругов игра заканчивается тем, что все игроки, кроме одного, сбрасывают все свои карты, а у последнего, проигравшего, оказывается на руках две карты: ведьма (дама пик) и другая дама.<br><br>Иногда ради веселья обязывают проигравшего (ведьму) надеть на голову женский платок и продолжать игру в нем, пока не выявится новый проигравший.</div>"	"0.00"	"Card"	"201"
