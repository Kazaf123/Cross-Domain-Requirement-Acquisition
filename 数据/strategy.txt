The plan outlined advance to Stalingrad and then the main force would turn south and drive to Caucasus to seize the crucial oil fields of Maykop, Gorzny, and Baku. As a preliminary step for the Case Blue, Wehrmacht was gearing up for two pincer attacks to cut off strong Soviet forces in the Izyum bulge, south of Kharkov, meaning German forces in the area were in offensive positions. However, just 6 days before the start date of the German operation, Red Army launched a massive campaign of their own from Izyum to re-take Kharkov, smashing directly into one of two the German armored pincers preparing for their own attack. German generals wanted to go on the defensive, but Berlin HQ ordered Wehrmacht to go on the offensive, and the resulting victory in the Second Battle of Kharkov wiped out strong mobile forces of Red Army in the southern sector of Eastern Front,  allowing the following Case Blue attacks to advance fairly effortlessly towards Stalingrad. This lack of fierce Soviet resistance mislead Germans to split their force into two: One group moving towards Stalingrad, the other south towards Caucasus. The split caused fatal logistic issues: Germans could not know which Corps would be advancing how much at any given week, so there was never enough fuel at the right time at the right place, forcing entire corps to stay put even when they faced only token Soviet formations, giving the Red Army time to rebuild their defenses along the river Volga and Caucasus mountains.<br><br><br><br>FEATURES:<br><br>+ Historical accuracy: Campaign mirrors the historical setup.<br><br>+ Good AI: Instead of just attacking on direct line towards the target, the AI opponent balances between strategic goals and smaller tasks like encircling nearby units.<br><br>+ Settings: A ton of options to alter the gaming experience: Change difficulty level, hexagon size, Animation, choose icon set for units (NATO or REAL) and cities (Round, Shield, Square, block of houses), turn supporting unit types like Generals/Airforce/Minefields ON/OFF, allow Storms and supply depots for combat units, and much more.<br><br><br>If you want to test this WWII game, a free 20-turn version is also available<br><br><br><br>Privacy Policy (full text on website and app menu): No account creation is possible, the made-up username used in the Hall of Fame listings is not tied to any account and does not have password.

One of the encircled German units was the 3rd SS Division Totenkopf, which earned its elite status in the fierce battles leading the defense of the pocket - a process in which the unit suffered 80% casualties. However, the German victory in Demyansk in 1942 paved way for a major German miscalculation a year later, when 300,000 German soldiers were encircled in Stalingrad in 1943, and based on the experiences from Demyansk the commanders were ordered to wait for the help instead of breaking out.<br><br>Game: You take the command of both the encircled units and the fresh divisions attempting to re-establish a land route from Staraya Russa to Demyansk as quickly as possible.

Panicking German Generals across the Third Reich desperately try to find men to throw in front of the Soviet offensive to stop it.

While hopeful Stalin keeps phoning the Soviet commanders daily about the success of the attack, the looming encirclement of epic proportions, and the imminent end of the war, Manstein is gathering huge Panzer groups on both flanks of the Red Army offensive. When those Panzers Corps are finally unleashed, they annihilate the overstretched attacking Soviet armies, swiftly retake Kharkov, and turn the whole situation upside down, forcing Soviet commanders to throw every unit available in front of the advancing Wehrmacht to prevent collapse.

Players alternate turns in a clockwise direction.<br>- When a 6 is rolled, the player may choose to advance a token already in play, or may enter another staged token to its starting square. Rolling a 6 earns the player an additional or ""bonus"" roll in that turn. If the bonus roll results in a 6 again, the player earns an additional bonus roll. If the third roll is also a 6, the player may not move and the turn immediately passes to the next player.<br>- Players may not end their move on a square they already occupy. If the advance of a token ends on a square occupied by an opponent's token, the opponent token is returned to its owner's yard. The returned token can be reentered into play only when the owner rolls a 6. Unlike Pachisi, there are no ""safe"" squares on the game track which protect a player's tokens from being returned. A player's home column squares are always safe, however, since no opponent may enter them.<br><br>Thank you for playing Ludo Bing - Best Board Game with Friends classic online game 2018 multiplayer with friends!</div>"	"0.00"	"Strategy"	"3073"

You start very humble, one cart, a purse of gold and silver coins is all that you have. Your task is to roam the world and search of opportunities to score some profit. Buy low, sell high - a merchant's motto is easy to grasp. And yet the job is harder than it seems.<br><br>A good merchant needs to know everything about the market, he is always on the lookout for a deal, always listening, always engaging and deepening his knowledge. He knows what forces influence the prices, what events affect them. A good merchant listens to rumours and gossips spread by travelers at inns and taverns; hoping for a clue, a hint where to go, where a good deal awaits. A good merchant surrounds himself with specialists smarter than him, people who help him maximize profits and minimize losses. He always expands his fleet of carts, he balances risks, calculates profitability.<br><br>The conditions are constantly changing, and supply and demand for different goods with them. Maybe you'd like to pay a cheaper price for furs in the summer, and sell them for a hefty profit as the winter is coming and people need warmth.<br>But is it worth carrying them for so many days, risking robbery, moths and taking precious space that you could use to transport something now and make a profit immediately?<br>Or is it worth to buy illegal herb in the out of reach swamps where it cost's next to nothing, and risk smuggling it into the city where you can sell it for an amazing profit? But what if the city guards want to control you? Should you pay a bribe? How big? Maybe the best course of action is to say that you have nothing and hope they don't find anything?<br><br>These are the types of questions you will have to ask yourself constantly.<br><br>- Merchants of Kaidan has 4 story lines each with many quests. Main quest that brings you closer to avenging your father's murder, and 3 side-quest lines. A total of over 100 quests each composed of multiple steps.<br>- A set of random events that influence your journeys. A storm on the sea, attack by dragons, highway robbery and many, many more.<br>- Three types of transport of your goods: by roads, by sea and by flight, each has its advantages and disadvantages and a unique set of events associated. As you grow your fleet you can join a partnership and you'll get to manage 3 traders.<br>- You can hire advisers each specializing in a different field. Their council will help you in a variety of issues. Some will show you short cuts on the roads, some will help you fight of the bandits, some will council you on how to sail better and in case of a storm, how to minimize risks and losses. If you wish, you can also send them to school to improve their abilities for additional cost.<br>- 4 seasons of the year that influence the prices of goods, open some paths for travel and block the others. They also impact the way the game looks, each city has a distinct look at different time of the year.<br>- Random blessings and curses that influence your statistics. They in turn affect how well you conduct business.<br>- A set of artefacts that influence your statistics or can help negate the effects of random events.<br>- A complex market fluctuation algorithm that include many variables such as: demand, supply, seasons of the year, localization of the city, random events like droughts or rat infestation.</div>"	"2.99"	"Strategy"	"245"

The campaign was a failure, and in the end British General John Burgoyne was forced to surrender to the Americans.

It's quite satisfying, though.“ <br>Jennifer Allen, 148Apps, 4/5 stars<br><br>„How many acronyms can you cram into a single game? Crowntakers is a PDL TBS RPG (that is, a procedural death labyrinth role-playing game with turn-based strategy combat) (…) and it’s really good fun if you like games like Final Fantasy Tactics.“<br>Michelle Star, CNET<br><br>≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈<br>User Ratings<br>≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈≈<br><br>5/5 - If you like turn based tactical medieval rpg's get this. Not as much story/length as final fantasy tactics, but frankly on iDevices I consider that a win. Bite sized battles, winnable in a day on easy, challenging on hard, good replay value. Only crashed once on 1st gen mini<br><br>5/5 - This is worth your money. You get a polished game, tactical battles, and thoughtful choices in exploration. Also big points for splitting the game into two difficulties. One being sort of roguelike with permadeath and the other much more RPG without permadeath and with consistent leveling. If you're thinking about this one, you'll probably thoroughly enjoy it like I do!<br><br>5/5 - This game should get much more hype. I've been playing it non-stop in my free time for over a week. Despite some bugs (which the dev's have been very quick to address), Each game feels quite different with the random locations within areas, random loot and different party builds. It's not easy at first, but learning different strategies as you go is enjoyable. Highly recommend this game!<br><br>5/5 - Big fan of this game. The battles are very tactical and the map navigation is really streamlined and fun to explore. This is a good one for any rogue-like fans. It's not super punishing, but it does present a nice challenge on the normal mode (haven't beaten it yet, but I hope a hard mode unlocks after doing so).</div>"	"2.49"	"Strategy"	"786"

A fight older than time itself.<br><br>Darkness is a chaotic force that seeks to throw all of the existence into mindless destruction. Light represents the will of those who wish to live in peace and harmony.<br><br>Darkness, mother of demons, made evil grow within the human heart. The union of her children with human beings created monsters, nowadays considered myths: living dead, vampires, witches, fairies, and, particularly, lycanthropes.<br><br>Light, creator of angels, granted hope and kindness unto the human soul. The children of angels and humans were the first heroes of old, also known as “Guardians”, people who can repel the attacks of monsters.<br><br>For reasons unknown, angels and demons drew back and allowed their descendants to continue the battle.<br><br>After thousands of years of war, the monsters defeated the Guardians.<br><br>When it seemed that humanity was lost, humans themselves found a way to salvation. A group of warriors, who called themselves the Order, invented the most powerful weapon of all: The Hunter.<br><br>There is only one Hunter each generation. The exact details of his forthcoming are unknown. Even though the Hunter has a human shape and fights for Light, he is truly the most powerful of monsters.<br><br>His power is unmeasurable, like the one of angels and demons who no longer prowl this earth. If he dies, like a phoenix, he is reborn.<br><br>With his unbeatable strength, he forced the creatures of Darkness to withdraw in defeat. However, the monsters remained, stalking from the shadows, waiting for a chance to defeat the Hunter, and once again rule over humanity.<br><br>Ten years ago, the lycanthropes were the first to attack. Somehow, they discovered that the Hunter had been reborn into a human child, no older than six. With brutal violence, they ravaged the child’s home, eliminating everyone who got in their way.<br><br>The lycanthropes destroyed your home, and murdered your parents.<br><br>Because you are the Hunter, and this is your story.<br><br>You managed to escape the first encounter with the Darkness. You survived, but you lost all your loved ones.<br><br>Why are you still alive?<br><br>Is it because you wish to find your own happiness, even if it means facing all the demons from Hell?<br><br>Is it revenge that pushes you to exterminate all lycanthropes?<br><br>Is it a sense of duty, of responsibility to defenseless creatures?<br><br>Your first choice is about the feeling that will guide your actions from now on:<br><br>CHOICE 1 – Friendship <br>Description: “I want to find my own wellbeing, though I don’t know what will make me happy in the future. To kill monsters, or to have a family and friends again?”<br><br>CHOICE 2 – Love <br>Description: “Killing the lycanthropes who took my parents is not enough. I won’t become just the Hunter they fear, the one that forces them to hide. No, that’s not enough, I will drag them out of their hiding holes and end them all, for good.

Less still, is the number of those whose exploration into this deathly site has yet to kill them. <br>Amidst this chaos, four separate factions arose as the universe’s superpowers: Auslia, En Eire, Kalthem and the Brigadier's of Armageddon operate independently, with varying purpose.<br>En Eire expanded from a guild of merchants; they now control trading systems across the cosmos, investing heavily in military and pharmaceutical industries. <br>Kalthem exist on the fringe, claiming to make the most advanced scientific strides they stop at nothing to gain the knowledge they seek. <br>Little is known of Auslia. Reports show their people live prosperously: protected by large shields they live insular lives, contributing little to the affairs of external factions.<br>The Brigadier's of Armageddon are pirates, preying primarily on En Eire’s expansive trading routes. Their members seem to experience the most freedom, though they have several powerful leaders. <br>We are an affiliation who recognises the threat of miasmic expansion: operating as a splinter group of the four great factions, we intend on locating and eradicating the source of that swelling pollutant before the macrocosm is entirely consumed.<br><br>Facebook:<br>https://www.facebook.com/MozgLabs<br>Mozg Labs:<br>http://www.mozglabs.com/</div>"	"3.99"	"Strategy"	"2365"

Here war is just a tool of the trade. <br><br>This game enables you to play as the ruler of Kievan Rus’, one of the mightiest states of the world of that time. The Middle Ages is a setting that is truly a treasure for any strategy game fan. In the game, there are 35 states, and Barbarians, who have their own territory and resources. <br><br>However, the ruler’s way to domination is not going to be a walk in the park. Get ready for deadly wars and backstairs politics – you will be confronted by the most powerful states of the game world, including England that dominates seas, Balkan states (Bulgaria, Poland, Hungary, Croatia and Serbia), and the Arab state of Syria, with a huge army at its disposal. So you think the Roman Empire has made great progress? Perhaps, you prefer European states, such as France and Scotland? Or it is Byzantium that you consider to be a good example? Let them know you are ready to fight head-to-head and build your own empire, and that you are a dictator and a strategist. Their aim is to advance their own civilization while preventing yours from doing so. Put your political foresight to the test and find out whether you are good at strategy and diplomacy – lead your country through ages and epochs.<br><br>To succeed, engage in wars with your rivals. Raise your own army and fleet, declare wars or start fighting in them when they are in full swing. Deploy spies and send saboteurs to your enemy country to find out what they are going to do. Invade states, conquer lands and capture rare resources.<br><br>A sagacious dictator is key to state policy success. Manage foreign affairs, conclude non-aggression pacts, and make suggestions to be considered by other states. Remember that diplomacy and well-thought-out policy are often more effective options than war. <br><br>Don’t forget about state economic activities: produce food, and manufacture weapons for your army. Use researches to increase the amount of manufactured goods and military capability. However, a single state cannot produce everything, so you will have to trade with other states and buy rare resources and goods. <br><br>Introduce new laws and make your citizens abide by them. You can establish the state religion of your choice. Appoint army and fleet commanders, and tax, trade, economy and construction chiefs. Separatism will not be tolerated: quell riots occurring in your state. Your empire will be mightiest, and diplomacy, weapons and economy will help you achieve it. <br><br>The game uses real-life states that existed at that time, with real historic events. The large and detailed map will enable you to see information about your own territory and that of other countries. These are just the game basics: you can find out how much it offers only by playing it. <br><br>The game does not require Internet connection, and you can play it anywhere you like. There is no set time limit for turns: you can choose the game pace to your liking.

Your planes are ready and are awaiting your orders.<br><br>HOW TO PLAY<br>-----------------------<br>This is a multiplayer guessing game for two players. It is played on a ruled board, on which each players fleet of airplanes are marked. The locations of the fleets are concealed from the other player. Players alternate turns calling ""shots"" at the other player's ships, and the objective of the game is to destroy the opposing airplane cockpits.<br>This is a battleship variation, known worldwide as a pencil and paper game which dates from World War I. <br><br>The battle starts with each player having to position their 3 airplanes on the board. After they designate each airplane, the game can begin. The player that starts is chosen randomly. Each turn has two parts:<br>1) The first player designates a particular box in the opponent board, for example B 4.<br>2) The opponent responds with one of the following possibilities:<br>- Air (miss) - the box chosen does contain any plane<br>- Hit - the box is part of a plane, but it is not the plane cockpit<br>- Destroyed - the box contains the cockpit of an airplane. The plane is now destroyed.<br><br>The first player who solves the puzzle and finds all three of the opposing airplane cockpits wins the game.<br><br>Honor<br>--------------<br>By fighting against opponents in multiplayer online games, you will earn honor points. The number of honor points you accumulate, determine the rank attributed to you by the command center. You have the opportunity to advance in your pilot career, promoting from Caporal to Sergeant, Lieutenant, Captain, Major, Colonel, Admiral or even Field Marshal.<br>You can check how much you need to advance to the next military rank, by tapping the main page, in game, on the name of your title.<br><br>This awesome production awaits you!

The Polish army, fighting without allies upheld against the invasion for 2 months but was eventually defeated by the third reich. In this game, the scenarios depict various key battles of the war, ranging from the initial border warfare to the siege of Warsaw.<br><br>Fans of hardcore hex strategy games might enjoy the fact that the game has actual World War II era German and Polish combat vehicles and armament, supply line mechanics, artillery counter attacks, maps based on the actual historical battles, and so forth. (Some liberties have been taken in interpreting few of the details, to make the game more entertaining. But we've tried to be as close to the course of events as possible.)<br><br>You can play either solo against the AI, or play multiplayer by passing the device between players after each turn. Network multiplayer is not currently supported. The single player game is played from the axis perspective; multiplayer has one player playing the German side and the other Polish side.<br><br>In case you'd like to play a quite similar type of a game set in ancient times, you might want to try out our Populus Romanus series also. It has a somewhat similar kind of tactics but in a Roman setting instead of modern times.</div>"	"2.49"	"Strategy"	"574"

It is very popular with gamers.<br><br>The early alloy warheads of 1996 were surprisingly not made by SNK, but by the work of Nazca, an unpopular, unpopular company. Metal warheads (MS1) that used MVS's powerful functions were nearly perfect at the time of appearance. With four-way jump shots, full range of main gun firepower, large power parabolic bombs and a knife with a very fast speed in close proximity, an all-powerful combat character was born. In addition, the “Metal Slug”, a must-have item for each stage, has all the necessary elements for a star. Everyone who has seen this game is fascinated by this Q-type small tank – nonsense. The tank, which will continue to fall, will simply be infused with life.<br><br>Classic style, exciting experience, Come and fight with us!<br><br>* We will also bring more classic arcade guides (including game cheats and customs clearance techniques) for everyone to follow.

Она интересна своим сюжетом, своей экономической составляющей. В игру, вместе с Вами, играет более 10.000 человек одновременно. <br> <br>Ваша цель построить небоскреб. Количество этажей в нем неограниченно. Главное чтобы у вас хватило ресурсов на возведение каждого этажа. <br>Основных валют в игре две — это монеты и баксы. После постройки очередного этажа, игроку необходимо решить, что он хочет разместить на каждом уровне.<br> <br>Вы можете отвести этаж под жилую зону либо выбрать одно из направлений бизнеса. <br>Например — развлечения, творчество или предприятия общественного питания. <br>Эти работяги и будут как раз из числа тех людей, что заселяют жилые зоны. <br> <br>Но вам необходимо иметь ввиду еще одно обстоятельство! У ваших виртуальных человечков в Небоскребе, как и в жизни, <br>имеются разные способности и склонности к работе. Кто то лучше может продавать пончики, кто то обучен работе в сфере развлечений. <br>Квалификация каждого работнику доступна вам сразу же после заселения его на этаж. И для того, чтобы улучшить продажи в определенном бизнесе, <br>от вас потребуется подходить к выбору работников весьма и весьма ответственно. Кроме этого, у всех ваших подопечных есть работа о которой они <br>мечтают. Таких трудоголиков следует размещать на соответствующей должности в первую очередь.<br> <br>В ваш небоскреб постоянно будут приходить покупатели, которых следует доставлять на определенный этаж. <br>Для этого в игре есть лифт, которым вы управляете самостоятельно. За оказанное внимание каждый покупатель помимо приобретение некоего товара может оставить вам и приличные чаевые — в виде монеток или даже баксов.<br><br>В каждом виде бизнеса имеется свой товар, за наличием которого вы должны следить. <br>В противном случае бизнес остановится и ваши доходы упадут. На создание товара требует реальное время. <br>Есть возможность и ускорить процесс создания новых товаров. Для этого вам придется заплатить. <br>Или больше — все зависит от спроса на товар и его первоначальной цены.<br><br>Также в режиме реального времени строятся и этажи в небоскребе. И чем выше он, тем больше времени требуется на строительство каждого этажа. <br>Однако и в данном случае строительство можно ускорить заплатив определенное количество баксов. Кроме этого, различные VIP-посетители могут <br>значительно сократить время постройки, если их доставить на соответствующий этаж.<br> <br>Постоянного присутствия в игре игрокам не требуется — она будет продолжена и после выхода из нее. <br>Это позволит вам получать монеты, но для того чтобы заработать баксы необходимо ваше активное участие в жизни небоскреба.<br><br>Небоскребе предоставляет множество инструментов для контроля игрового бизнеса и настроения ваших граждан. <br><br>Небоскребе с первого взгляда может показаться скучной и однообразной игрой. Но после постройки первых 10 этажей, налаживания бизнеса и заселения небоскреба <br>жителями вам придется следить за различными аспектами игры и учитывать ваши доходы и расходы. Так как игра распространяется бесплатно попробовать свои силы <br>может каждый. <br><br>Станьте магнатом недвижимости в мобильной экономической стратегии Небоскребы.<br><br>Покупайте этажи, чтобы заработать, стройте новые дома... стройте свой город. <br><br>В игре отображаются экономические, рыночные процессы. Игрок руководит домом или городом, а целью является извлечение прибыли.</div>"	"0.00"	"Strategy"	"23716"

In response to the resource crisis, the two most powerful corporations, BIOSPHERE and APEX, set off to lead a space expedition. To their amazement they discovered extensive resources on a strange planet far off of even the largest star maps. It contained precious exotic minerals whose energy levels were off the chart. This was earths answer. BIOSPHERE immediately started mining in anticipation of the prosperity and promise that the minerals could have for Earth. However, APEX saw the minerals as a highly lucrative business opportunity and promptly declared ownership of the planet and its vast resources. They ruthlessly engaged BIOSPHERE’s forces intent on wiping them out. Only one corporation will make it back to Earth alive. The answer is up to you!<br> <br>=== Description ===<br>MechCom is a new fast-paced stable 3D action RTS that is optimized for mobile devices. It’s heavily influenced by the popular open-source RTS, Warzone 2100 and Dune (But it is NOT an Android clone). It takes place in the year 2100 when two corporations (BIOSPHERE and APEX) go at it deploying powerful mechs and heavy hardware from the mothership in a classic RTS environment in the hunt for resources. It uses fluid touch controls that are aimed for simplicity and ease of use. Classic old-school resource collection mechanics are favored as well as simple clear graphics. There are a number of customized mechs you can build as well as various structures. There are also a handful of upgrades that you can utilize which can mean the difference between victory and defeat against a clever and challenging AI. Finally there are a large number of maps (zones) to choose from for Custom Games or you can go with a Ranked Game where the computer matches you to your skill level depending on your rank and how many promotion points you have earned to keep you challenged.<br><br>=== How To Play ===<br>Gameplay primarily consists of building individual units and structures on build pads. You build a refinery to harvest minerals and convert them to money. You then use the money to build a broad assortment of unit components, upgrades and an assortment of structures such as an Armory to unlock multiple component upgrades (also costing money) and a turret for example. Once you create your army, you can converge on the map to take control of Beacons where you can deploy more units. Capturing and keeping Beacons is vital in making your way across the map. Engage and eliminate all opponent units and structures to be declared the victor. <br><br>=== Game Features ===<br>•  Basic Tutorial.<br>•  Challenging AI.<br>•  Simple 3D graphics.<br>•  7 Ranks to progress though.<br>•  Simple large touch controls.<br>•  12 maps set in 3 different landscapes.<br>•  NO ADS OR IN-APP PURCHASES EVER!<br>•  Old-school resources collection system.<br>•  2 game modes (Ranked Game and Custom Game).<br>•  16 unique combinations of mechs PLUS UPGRADES!<br><br>=== Game Tips ===<br>• Strongest is not always best.<br>• Upgrades and key to victory.<br>• Hover chassis can go over water and works great for scouts.<br>• Speed is important. Build as fast and as efficiently as you can.<br>• Capture and keep as many Beacons as you can for the advantage.<br>• Collect as many minerals as you can before the enemy collects them all.<br><br>=== Guide ===<br>v1.2 Guide Screenshots: http://gamedev-team.blogspot.ru/2013/07/mechcom-3d-rts-guide.html<br>v1.3 Tech Tree: http://gamedev-team.blogspot.ru/2013/07/mechcom-3d-rts-tech-tree.html<br><br>Special thanks to Shane McLaffery for testing and development support.</div>"	"0.99"	"Strategy"	"3374"
